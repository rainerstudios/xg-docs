Migrating from another provider? We will migrate your server data for you completely free of charge. Think of it as a welcome gift to XGamingServer!

To have the XGamingServer team migrate your server for you, complete the below step 1 and [contact our team](https://xgamingserver.com/contact). We will get the data and server migrated and set up for you.

## Migrating to XGamingServer

### 1. Zip up server files 

To make the transfer easy and seamless, select all files and data at your existing provider and archive them into a .zip or similar.

### 2. Upload the archive

Once you've created the archive, download it to your computer. Then, upload the archive to the **Files** tab on the XGamingServer game panel.

If the file size is too large, [use SFTP](./panel/importing-files) to import the archive.

### 3. Unpack the archive

Once it's uploaded, unpack the archive by clicking the three dots and select **Unarchive**. Make sure all other files are deleted before you unpack. 

Then, ensure the server settings match the server data you are importing. For example, if you are migrating a Minecraft server, ensure you've selected the right software (e.g Forge, Fabric, Paper, etc). 

If it isn't set to the correct settings, update the settings in the **Startup** tab on the game panel to match the config of your existing server.

### 4. Start the server!

Once you've imported your save data and ensured the configuration options and settings are appropriate to what you're running, start the server!

If the server fails to start, [contact support](https://xgamingserver.com/contact).
