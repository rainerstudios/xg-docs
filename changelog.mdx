  We've redesigned our website from the ground up with a more familiar gaming-esque feel while spotlighting XGamingServer's brand colours. It's faster, easier to navigate, and a consistent pixel-perfect design.

  Designed and developed by our sister company [Lusory](https://lusory.net).

  ### Dedicated Servers

  After months of private beta, we're launching bare metal dedicated servers to the public with competitive prices and the latest gaming hardware; perfect for large communities or networks.

  For our launch, we've released three models — all using top-of-the-line Ryzen 9 CPUs and Gen 4 NVMe SSDs — in two datacenter locations: **Dallas, Texas**, and **Seattle, Washington**.

  The network is backed with the same the same terabit-scale DDoS protection you know and love included absolutely free with every server. Managed game panel & BGP sessions are also available as an addon.

  ### Support for more games

  Behind the scenes, we've been ramping up our server fleet by continuing to invest in our own hardware while expanding our global presence to serve more users around the world.

  With this, we're able to handle high loads of demand and continuously add support for more games with more being added every week!

  p.s, small nifty detail: the search bar on the [/games](https://xgamingserver.com/games) page now recognizes aliases of games, e.g, "mc" -> "Minecraft", or "7DTD" and "7D2D" -> "7 Days to Die".
