## Changing the version

1. Take a backup of your server, just in case something goes wrong. Makes life
   much easier in the long run.
2. Stop your server.
3. In the "**Minecraft**" tab, change the `Version` variable to the version you want
   to use.
4. In the "**Settings**" tab, press "**Reinstall**" to start the update process.
5. Start your server and run the `/version` command to check that the version
   has changed.

### What Java version do I need for each version in Minecraft?

You may encounter a Java error in the console when updating a new version, this
could mean that you have an incompatible Java version. To fix this, you can
update your Java version or change the `Java Version` variable in the
"**Settings**" tab to the appropriate version:

    * **Java 8**: Minecraft 1.8+
    * **Java 11**: Minecraft 1.16+
    * **Java 16**: Minecraft 1.17+
    * **Java 17:** Minecraft 1.18+

And voilà, you're done! You can now enjoy your new version of Minecraft.
