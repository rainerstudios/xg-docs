description: "While our team is in the process of developing a modpack manager solution to be
integrated into Lime, we'll have to stick with a manual installation for now."

## Installation

To install a modpack,
[upload the modpack's server archive](/lime/importing-files) (usually in a
`.zip` format) to your file manager. Once uploaded, you will need to find the
required Forge version specified in the modpack's readme file or on the
modpack's webpage. In the "Minecraft" tab, input the version number (e.g.
`1.16.5-36.2.39`) and press **Reinstall** in the "Settings" tab to download the
necessary Forge version.

Next, delete all files except for your modpack and select **Reinstall** again.
Start the server at least once, then unpack the modpack's archive file. Finally,
restart the server to complete the modpack installation process.

If the .zip of the modpack opens a folder, head into that folder and select all
the files. Then, press the "Archive" button and move the archived file into the
main directory. This can be done by pressing the **Move** button and adding a
`../` behind the name of the file (e.g `../archive-2023-01-08T021140Z.tar.gz`).
This will move the file one directory up. Then, press the **Unarchive** button,
that will extract the files into the main directory.
