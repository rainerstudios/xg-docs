[Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky) is a Bukkit plugin (or a mod), that
can be used to pre-generate chunks for a Minecraft server.<br/> World
pre-generation helps with reducing CPU usage in the long-term, since players
move through chunks that are already generated.

## Installation

### Bukkit-based servers

To get started with pre-generating your world on a Bukkit-based server, download the plugin's JAR file from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/).<br/>
Before using the plugin, place the downloaded JAR file into your `plugins` folder (either drag and drop into the file manager or [use SFTP](../../lime/importing-files)).

### Forge or Fabric-based servers

To pre-generate worlds on modded servers, download the mod's file from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunky-pregenerator-forge) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/chunky).<br/>
Once downloaded, place the downloaded JAR file into your `/mods` folder (either drag and drop into the file manager or [use SFTP](../../lime/importing-files)).

Restart the server and Chunky should be good to go!

## Usage

Using the plugin is fairly easy, however always take a backup of your server before you start, just to be on the safe side.

Chunky is a powerful tool with loads of commands, but we will only use these:

1. `/chunky radius <chunk-size>` - sets the radius from the center to be pre-generated
    - the radius is how many blocks from the center chunk will be pre-generated
2. `/chunky center <x> <z>` - sets the center of the chunks to be pre-generated
    - the center is the chunk that the pre-generation will start from, most people should leave it as default, but it can be changed
3. `/chunky setcorners <x1> <z1> <x2> <z2>` - sets the corners of the chunks to be pre-generated
4. `/chunky start` - starts the generation process
5. `/chunky pause` - pauses the generation process
6. `/chunky resume` - resumes the generation process
7. `/chunky stop` - stops the generation process
8. `/chunky status` - shows the status of the generation process

See [Chunky's documentation](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky/wiki) for more commands and useful tips.

### Example

To pregenerate a 5000x5000 chunk area centered at `0,0`, you would use the following commands:

- `/chunky radius 5000`
- `/chunky center 0 0`
- `/chunky start`

<Warning>
    Don't go crazy high with the radius! It can take a while (hours in fact) to pre-generate a world.

    Although you can play while running the plugin, you **will** experience some noticeable lag, so it's best to start it before you head to bed and wake up to a pre-generated server in the morning.
</Warning>
<Warning>
    Note that pre-generation increases world size substantially, so make sure you have enough free space on your disk. Check out [onlinemo.de/world](https://onlinemo.de/world) to calculate how large your world(s) will be before pregenerating them.
</Warning>

Once Chunky is done, all the chunks from X 5000 and Z 5000 to X -5000 and Z-5000 have been pre-generated.
