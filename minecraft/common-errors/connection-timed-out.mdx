title: "Connection timed out"
---

If you are experiencing high ping or getting timed out while playing a game, it
could be due to one of the following reasons:

1. The game server (or proxy, e.g. BungeeCord/Velocity) has insufficient
   resources to handle the amount of players.
2. There is an outage/issue with our network - you can check out our monitoring
   [here](https://status.berrybyte.net/).
3. The proxy (e.g. BungeeCord/Velocity) is misconfigured (only applies if you
   have one).
4. There is a problem with your
   [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) - this is the
   case most of the time.

## Remedy

- Double-check your proxy's configuration, if you have one.
- See if anybody else experiences these issues on your server, if not, it's most
  likely a problem with your connection.
- Use [Cloudflare's WARP](https://1.1.1.1/) - a tool that helps you connect to a network with more optimized routes. This is a popular remedy especially for lower-end connections.
- Increase the
  [`paper.playerconnection.keepalive`](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/reference/system-properties#paperplayerconnectionkeepalive)
  timeout property (Paper-forks only).
- Take an MTR (my trace-route) and analyze the output.

<Tip>Example: add `-Dpaper.playerconnection.keepalive=90` to your startup flags; extends the keepalive timeout to 90 seconds.</Tip>
