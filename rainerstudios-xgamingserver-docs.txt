# Suspensions and Terminations

This guide explains the difference between account suspensions and service terminations, why they occur, and what steps you can take to resolve these situations.

## Account Suspensions vs. Service Terminations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Account Suspension" icon="pause-circle">
    A temporary hold on your service due to payment issues or policy violations. Your data is preserved, and service can be restored.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Termination" icon="ban">
    Permanent closure of your service and deletion of all associated data. This typically follows extended suspension or serious policy violations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Accounts Get Suspended

Accounts may be suspended for several reasons:

### 1. Payment Issues

The most common reason for suspension is payment failure, which can occur due to:
- Expired credit card
- Insufficient funds
- Failed PayPal subscription
- Billing information errors
- Disputed charges or chargebacks

### 2. Terms of Service Violations

Violations that may lead to suspension include:
- Hosting prohibited content
- Server resource abuse
- Unauthorized penetration testing
- DDoS attacks originating from your server
- Using the service for illegal activities

### 3. Compliance Issues

Sometimes suspensions occur due to:
- Incomplete verification information
- Suspected fraudulent activity
- DMCA takedown notices
- Law enforcement requests

## The Suspension Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Warning notification">
    Before suspension, we attempt to notify you about impending issues via email. This is why keeping your contact information updated is crucial.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Service suspension">
    If the issue isn't resolved, your service will be suspended. During suspension:
    - Your server will be inaccessible
    - Control panel access is limited
    - Your data remains intact
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notification of suspension">
    We send an email explaining the reason for suspension and steps to resolve it.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/suspension-email.jpg" alt="Suspension Email Example" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolution period">
    You typically have 7-14 days to resolve the issue before the account moves toward termination. The exact timeframe depends on the nature of the suspension.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resolving a Suspension

The steps to resolve a suspension depend on the reason:

### For Payment-Related Suspensions

1. Log in to your [billing dashboard](https://panel.xgamingserver.com/billing)
2. Navigate to Invoices > Unpaid
3. Review and pay any outstanding invoices
4. Update your payment method if necessary

    Before termination, we send a final notice giving you a last opportunity to resolve the issues.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Service termination">
    If no resolution occurs, the service is terminated and queued for data deletion.

  <Step title="Data deletion">
    All server data is permanently deleted within 48-72 hours after termination.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Account closure">

# Why Was My Order Status Listed as Fraud

If your order has been flagged as potentially fraudulent, don't worry—this is a protective measure that can be resolved. This guide explains why orders get flagged, what it means, and how to get your order approved.

## Why Orders Get Flagged as Potential Fraud

XGamingServer uses an automated fraud detection system to protect both customers and our business. Orders may be flagged for various reasons:

### Common Flag Triggers

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Location Mismatch" icon="globe">
    Your IP address location differs significantly from your billing address
  </Card>
  <Card title="High-Risk Regions" icon="map-pin">
    Order placed from regions with historically high fraud rates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mismatched Information" icon="id-card">
    Discrepancies between provided information and payment provider data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Failed Attempts" icon="repeat">
    Several failed payment attempts before successful payment
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unusual Purchase Pattern" icon="chart-line">
    Order pattern differs from typical customer behavior
  </Card>
  <Card title="VPN/Proxy Usage" icon="mask">
    Order placed through VPN or proxy service
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Being flagged for fraud review does NOT mean we believe you are committing fraud. It's simply a security measure to verify legitimate orders and protect your payment information.
</Note>

## What Happens When an Order is Flagged

When an order is flagged for potential fraud:

1. **Order Status**: Your order status changes to "Fraud Review" in your client area
2. **Service Status**: Your server is not provisioned until the review is complete
3. **Notification**: You receive an email notification about the review
4. **Payment Hold**: Your payment is authorized but not fully processed
5. **Manual Review**: Our fraud prevention team reviews your order

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/fraud-review-status.jpg" alt="Fraud Review Status Example" />
</Frame>

## How to Resolve a Fraud Flag

If your order has been flagged for fraud review, here's how to get it resolved quickly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your email">
    Look for an email with the subject "Order Verification Required" in your inbox and spam folder. This email contains important information about next steps.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/fraud-email.jpg" alt="Fraud Review Email Example" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reply with verification">
    Respond to the verification email with the requested identification information, which may include:
    
    - A copy of your ID (driver's license, passport, or national ID)
    - A photo of the payment card used (showing only the last 4 digits)
    - A utility bill or bank statement showing your billing address
    
    <Info>
      For privacy, you can blur out or cover sensitive information not required for verification.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete verification form">
    In some cases, you may be directed to complete a secure verification form instead of sending documents via email.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for review">
    Our fraud prevention team will review your information, typically within 1-12 hours during business hours.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Order approval">
    Once verified, your order will be approved, and your server will be provisioned automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expediting the Review Process

To get your order approved faster:

1. **Provide clear information**: Ensure all verification documents are clear and readable
2. **Respond quickly**: Prompt responses speed up the verification process
3. **Use official documents**: Government-issued IDs are preferred for verification
4. **Contact support**: If you haven't received a response within 24 hours, contact our support team

## Preventing Future Fraud Flags

To avoid having future orders flagged:

- **Use consistent information**: Ensure billing address matches your payment method's registered address
- **Disable VPN**: Turn off VPN or proxy services when placing orders
- **Verify payment details**: Double-check that all payment information is accurate
- **Use verified payment methods**: Previously verified payment methods are less likely to trigger flags
- **Update your profile**: Keep your account information current and accurate

## If Your Order Is Declined

In some cases, after review, an order may still be declined if:

- Verification documents could not be validated
- High-risk indicators could not be resolved
- Payment processor enforced restrictions
- Discrepancies could not be explained

If your legitimate order is declined, please contact our billing team directly at [billing@xgamingserver.com](mailto:billing@xgamingserver.com) with:

1. Your order number
2. A detailed explanation
3. Alternative payment method (if applicable)
4. Any additional verification you can provide

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will I be charged for an order under fraud review?">
    Your payment method will show an authorization hold, but you won't be charged until the order is approved. If the order is declined, the authorization is released.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does the verification process take?">
    Most verifications are completed within 1-12 hours during business hours. Complex cases may take up to 24 hours.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I place a new order instead of waiting for verification?">
    We recommend waiting for the verification process to complete. Creating multiple orders may trigger additional fraud flags.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my personal information secure during verification?">
    Yes, all verification documents are handled according to our Privacy Policy, stored securely, and deleted after verification is complete.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Upgrading Your Service

As your server grows in popularity or your needs change, you may find that you need more resources. This guide explains how to upgrade your XGamingServer service to a higher plan.

## When to Upgrade Your Server

Consider upgrading your server if you're experiencing:

- **Performance issues**: Lag, slow loading times, or server crashes
- **Memory warnings**: Frequent "out of memory" errors in your logs
- **CPU bottlenecks**: High CPU usage consistently above 80%
- **Disk space limitations**: Running out of storage space
- **Player capacity issues**: Unable to accommodate your growing community

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/upgrade-indicators.jpg" alt="Server Resource Indicators" />
</Frame>

## Understanding Your Upgrade Options

XGamingServer offers several upgrade paths:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Vertical Scaling" icon="arrow-up">
    Increase RAM, CPU, and storage on your existing server
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add-On Services" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Add specific resources like extra RAM or storage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Premium Plans" icon="crown">
    Upgrade to premium tiers with additional features
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Solutions" icon="sliders">
    Tailor-made configurations for specific needs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to Upgrade Your Server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your account">
    Go to the [XGamingServer control panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com) and log in with your credentials.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to your services">
    Click on "Billing" in the main navigation, then select "Services" from the dropdown menu.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/billing-services-menu.jpg" alt="Billing Services Menu" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the server to upgrade">
    Locate the server you wish to upgrade and click the "Manage" button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access upgrade options">
    Look for the "Upgrade/Downgrade" or "Change Plan" button, typically located in the service details page.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/upgrade-button.jpg" alt="Upgrade Button" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your new plan">
    Browse the available upgrade options and select the plan that best meets your needs. You'll see a comparison between your current plan and the selected upgrade.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/plan-comparison.jpg" alt="Plan Comparison" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the upgrade details">
    Before confirming, review:
    - Price difference
    - New billing amount
    - Prorated charges (if applicable)
    - Resource changes
    - Effective date
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm and complete payment">
    Click the "Upgrade" button and complete any required payment for the upgrade. In many cases, you'll only pay the prorated difference between your current plan and the new plan.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Server upgrade process">
    After confirmation, your server will begin the upgrade process:
    1. You'll receive a confirmation email
    2. Your server may experience a brief downtime during the upgrade
    3. Once complete, your server will restart with the new resources
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Prorated Billing for Upgrades

When you upgrade mid-billing cycle, we calculate prorated charges to ensure you only pay for what you use:

1. You receive a credit for the unused portion of your current plan
2. You're charged for the new plan from the upgrade date until the end of your billing cycle

<Info>
  Prorated charges are calculated based on the number of days remaining in your current billing period. This ensures a fair and transparent upgrade process.
</Info>

### Example Calculation

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/proration-example.jpg" alt="Proration Example" />
</Frame>

In this example:
- Current plan: $20/month
- New plan: $30/month
- 15 days remaining in billing cycle (out of 30 days)
- Credit for unused portion: $10 (50% of $20)
- Charge for new plan: $15 (50% of $30)
- Total prorated charge: $5 ($15 - $10)

## Upgrade FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will my server data be preserved during an upgrade?">
    Yes, all your server data, configurations, and game files are preserved during the upgrade process. However, we recommend creating a backup before any upgrade as a precaution.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does the upgrade process take?">
    Most upgrades are completed within 5-30 minutes, depending on the size of your server and the extent of the upgrade. During this time, your server may be temporarily unavailable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I upgrade in the middle of my billing cycle?">
    Yes, you can upgrade at any time. We use prorated billing to ensure you only pay for the difference between your old and new plans for the remainder of your billing cycle.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I need to downgrade later?">
    Downgrades follow a similar process but are typically scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. See our [changing plans](./changing-plans) guide for more information.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

| Pending | Order received but not yet processed | 5-30 minutes |
| Fraud Check | Order flagged for security verification | 1-12 hours |
| Processing | Order approved and being set up | 5-15 minutes |
| Active | Server is set up and ready to use | N/A |
| Failed | Order could not be processed | N/A |

## Resolving a Pending Order

The steps to resolve a pending order depend on the reason for the pending status:

### For Payment Verification

Most payment verifications resolve automatically within 30 minutes. If your order has been pending for longer:

1. Check your email for any verification requests from our payment processor
2. Verify that your payment method has sufficient funds
3. Ensure your billing address matches the address on file with your payment provider

### For Manual Review Orders

If your order requires manual review:

1. Check your email for any requests for additional information
2. Respond promptly to any verification emails
3. Contact our billing team if you haven't received any communication within 12 hours

### For Resource Allocation Delays

Resource allocation typically happens automatically, but during high-demand periods:

1. Wait for the automated process to complete (usually within 30 minutes)
2. Check your order status occasionally for updates
3. Contact support if the status doesn't change after 1 hour

## Expediting Your Pending Order

If you need your server urgently, here are steps to expedite the process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for verification emails">
    First, check your email (including spam folder) for any verification requests that might be holding up your order.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Contact live support">
    Our live chat support can often check the status of your order in real-time and help resolve simple issues.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/live-chat-support.jpg" alt="Live Chat Support" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit a support ticket">
    If live chat is unavailable, submit a support ticket with your order number and a request for expedited processing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Try an alternative payment method">
    If payment issues are causing the delay, you can try placing a new order with a different payment method.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel a pending order?">
    Yes, you can cancel a pending order by contacting our billing team. No charges will be finalized for cancelled pending orders.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if my order fails after being pending?">
    If an order fails, any authorization holds will be released, and you'll receive an email explaining the reason for the failure. You can then address the issue and place a new order.
  </Accordion>

================================================
FILE: development.mdx
================================================
---
title: "Development tbd"
description: "Preview changes locally to update your docs"
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding. 

  
  Please upgrade to `docs.json` before proceeding and delete the legacy `mint.json` file.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install Mintlify:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```


```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `docs.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run Mintlify on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```


```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/checks-passed.png"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and deploy them to the public.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 
    1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `docs.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
    <Note>
      If you’re currently using the legacy ```mint.json``` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:


      ```npm i -g mintlify@latest```
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      ```mintlify upgrade```
      You should now be using the new ```docs.json``` configuration file. Feel free to delete the ```mint.json``` file from your repository.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Update your docs

Add content directly in your files with MDX syntax and React components. You can use any of our components, or even build your own.

<CardGroup>

<Card title="Add Content With MDX" icon="file" href="/essentials/markdown">

</Card>

<Card
  title="Add Code Blocks"
  icon="square-code"

</Card>

<Card
  title="Add Images"

</Card>

<Card
  title="Add Custom Components"
  icon="puzzle-piece"

# Valheim Server Setup

Setting up your Valheim server on XGamingServer is quick and easy. Follow these steps to get started with your Viking adventure.

## Creating Your Server

1. Log in to your [XGamingServer control panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com)
2. Click the **Create Server** button
3. Select **Valheim** from the game list
4. Choose your server plan based on your needs:

| Plan | RAM | CPU | Storage | Recommended Players |
|------|-----|-----|---------|---------------------|
| Basic | 4GB | 2 cores | 10GB | 1-5 |
| Standard | 8GB | 4 cores | 20GB | 5-10 |
| Premium | 16GB | 6 cores | 40GB | 10+ |

5. Select your server location (choosing a location close to your players will reduce latency)
6. Enter your server name, world name, and password
7. Click **Create Server**

Your server will be ready in a few minutes.

## Initial Configuration

Once your server is created, you'll need to configure some basic settings:

1. Navigate to the **Startup** tab in your server control panel
2. Configure the following settings:
   - **Server Name**: The name displayed in the server browser
   - **World Name**: Name of your world file (this is important for backups)
   - **Server Password**: Required for players to join (minimum 5 characters)
   - **Public**: Whether your server is visible in the public server list

<Note>
For security reasons, we strongly recommend setting a password for your Valheim server.
</Note>

## Connecting to Your Server

Players can connect to your Valheim server in two ways:

### In-Game Server Browser

# Importing Content from WordPress

This guide explains how to import content from your WordPress site into the XGamingServer documentation.

## Prerequisites

- A WordPress XML export file
- Linux/WSL environment with `xmlstarlet` installed
- Basic command line knowledge

## Step 1: Export WordPress Content

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Go to Tools > Export
3. Choose to export "All content"
4. Download the XML file

## Step 2: Run the Import Script

1. Place the WordPress XML export file in the same directory as the `import-from-wordpress.sh` script
2. Update the `WORDPRESS_EXPORT_FILE` variable in the script to match your export filename
3. Run the script:

```bash
chmod +x import-from-wordpress.sh
./import-from-wordpress.sh
```

## Step 3: Organize Imported Content

1. The script will create a `wordpress_content` directory with MDX files
2. Review each file and move it to the appropriate game directory
3. Rename files according to the guide structure (e.g., `setup.mdx`, `configuration.mdx`)
4. Update any internal links or image paths

## Step 4: Process Images

1. Download images from your WordPress site
2. Place them in the appropriate `images/games/[game-name]` directories
3. Update image references in MDX files from WordPress URL to local path

## Step 5: Test the Documentation

1. Run `mintlify dev` to preview the documentation
2. Check that all imported content displays correctly
3. Fix any formatting issues or broken links

# Setting Up Automatic Server Backups

Regular backups are crucial for protecting your game server data. This guide explains how to set up, manage, and restore backups using the XGamingServer control panel.

## Backup System Overview

The XGamingServer backup system allows you to:
- Create manual backups at any time
- Schedule automatic backups at regular intervals
- Download backups to your local computer
- Restore backups to your server
- Configure backup rotation policies

## Creating Manual Backups

To create a backup immediately:

1. Log in to your [XGamingServer control panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com)
2. Select your game server
3. Navigate to the **Backups** tab
4. Click the **Create Backup** button
5. Enter an optional name for your backup (recommended for easy identification)
6. Select which folders/files to include
7. Click **Create Backup**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/game-panel/create-backup.jpg" alt="Creating a Manual Backup" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Creating a backup may temporarily increase server load. For large servers, we recommend scheduling backups during low-activity periods.
</Note>

## Setting Up Scheduled Backups

To set up automatic backups:

1. Go to the **Schedules** tab in your server's control panel
2. Click **Create Schedule**
3. Select **Backup** as the task type
4. Configure the following settings:
   - **Name**: Give your backup schedule a descriptive name
   - **Frequency**: Choose how often the backup should run
   - **First Run**: Set when the first backup should occur
   - **Files to backup**: Select which directories to include
   - **Backup retention**: How many backups to keep before rotation

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/game-panel/scheduled-backup.jpg" alt="Configuring Scheduled Backups" />
</Frame>

### Recommended Backup Frequencies

| Server Type | Recommended Frequency | Retention |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Low activity | Weekly | 4 backups |
| Medium activity | Twice weekly | 6 backups |
| High activity | Daily | 7 backups |
| Mission critical | Twice daily | 10 backups |

## Managing Your Backups

All your backups are listed in the **Backups** tab. For each backup, you can:

- **Download**: Save the backup to your local computer
- **Restore**: Restore this backup to your server
- **Lock**: Prevent the backup from being automatically deleted during rotation
- **Delete**: Permanently remove the backup

<Warning>
  Restoring a backup will overwrite existing files on your server. Make sure you have a backup of your current state before restoring an older backup.
</Warning>

## Backup Rotation

Backup rotation helps manage storage space by automatically removing old backups. Here's how it works:

1. You set the maximum number of backups to keep (retention policy)
2. When this limit is reached, the oldest unlocked backup is deleted
3. Locked backups are never automatically deleted

To lock an important backup:
1. Go to the **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup you want to protect
3. Click the **Lock** icon

<Tip>
  Lock important backups like those taken before major updates or significant server changes.
</Tip>

## Restoring From a Backup

To restore your server from a backup:

1. Go to the **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup you want to restore
3. Click the **Restore** button
4. Confirm the restoration

<Warning>
  Restoring a backup will stop your server during the process. Players will be disconnected until the restoration is complete and the server is restarted.
</Warning>

The restoration process:
1. Stops the game server
2. Extracts the backup
3. Replaces the current files with the backup files
4. Restarts the server (if it was running before)

## Downloading Backups

To download a backup to your computer:

1. Go to the **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup you want to download
3. Click the **Download** button
4. Save the file to your preferred location

<Note>
  Backups are compressed archives. You'll need a program like 7-Zip, WinRAR, or a similar utility to extract them.
</Note>

## Best Practices for Server Backups

- **Multiple backup schedules**: Consider having both daily and weekly backup schedules
- **Test your backups**: Periodically restore a backup in a test environment to ensure it works
- **External storage**: Download important backups to your local computer for extra safety
- **Document changes**: Add notes to your backups describing major server changes
- **Pre-update backups**: Always create a backup before installing updates or making significant changes

## Troubleshooting Backup Issues

### Backup Creation Fails

If your backup fails to create:
1. Check if you have sufficient storage space on your server plan
2. Ensure the server isn't experiencing excessive load
3. Try creating a backup with fewer files/directories
4. Contact support if the issue persists

### Backup Restoration Fails

If your backup fails to restore:
1. Verify the backup file isn't corrupted
2. Check server logs for specific error messages
3. Ensure you have sufficient storage space for the restored files
4. Try restarting the server before attempting restoration again

2. Enter a name for your schedule (e.g., "Daily Morning Restart")
3. Select your schedule timing:
   - **Minute**: The minute of the hour (0-59)
   - **Hour**: The hour of the day (0-23, using 24-hour format)
   - **Day of Month**: The day of the month (1-31)
   - **Month**: The month of the year (1-12)
   - **Day of Week**: The day of the week (0-6, where 0 is Sunday)
4. Select **Send Command** as the task type
5. In the command field, enter a restart command appropriate for your game
6. Enable the **Only When Server Is Online** option
7. Click **Create Schedule**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/game-panel/create-schedule.jpg" alt="Creating a Restart Schedule" />
</Frame>

### Common Restart Commands

Different games may use different restart commands:

| Game | Restart Command |
|------|----------------|
| Minecraft | `say Server restarting in 1 minute! && sleep 50 && say Server restarting in 10 seconds! && sleep 10 && stop` |
| Valheim | `broadcast "Server restarting in 60 seconds..." 60 server_restart` |
| ARK | `broadcast Server restarting in 60 seconds... && save world && sleep 60 && quit` |
| Rust | `say "Server restarting in 60 seconds" && sleep 60 && quit` |
| 7 Days to Die | `shutdown 60` |

<Tip>
  Add warning messages to your restart commands to notify players before the server goes down.
</Tip>

## Schedule Timing Examples

Here are some common scheduling patterns:

| Schedule Description | Minute | Hour | Day (Month) | Month | Day (Week) |
|---------------------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Every day at 3 AM | 0 | 3 | * | * | * |
| Every 6 hours | 0 | 0,6,12,18 | * | * | * |
| Every Sunday at 4 AM | 0 | 4 | * | * | 0 |
| First day of every month | 0 | 0 | 1 | * | * |
| Every 12 hours | 0 | 0,12 | * | * | * |

<Info>
  The asterisk (*) represents "every" in CRON notation. For example, * in the Month field means "every month."
</Info>

## Advanced Scheduling Options

### Creating a Warning Schedule

For a smoother player experience, set up warning messages before restarts:

1. Create a new schedule
2. Time it 5-10 minutes before your restart schedule
3. Select **Send Command** as the task type
4. Enter a warning command (e.g., `say Server will restart in 10 minutes`)
5. Click **Create Schedule**

### Chaining Multiple Commands

You can chain multiple commands in a single schedule by using `&&` between commands:

```
say Server maintenance in 5 minutes && sleep 240 && say Server maintenance in 1 minute && sleep 60 && stop
```

### Running a Specific Game Script

If your game uses scripts for certain functions:

1. Create a new schedule
2. Select **Send Command** as the task type
3. Reference your script (e.g., `runscript backup_world.lua`)
4. Click **Create Schedule**

## Managing Your Schedules

To manage your existing schedules:

- **Edit**: Click the edit button next to a schedule to modify its settings
- **Delete**: Click the delete button to remove a schedule
- **Disable/Enable**: Toggle the switch to temporarily disable or enable a schedule
- **Run Now**: Click the "Run Now" button to execute a schedule immediately

</Frame>

## Best Practices for Server Restarts

- **Off-peak scheduling**: Schedule restarts during low-activity periods
- **Consistent timing**: Use the same time each day to create a predictable pattern for players
- **Multiple warnings**: Set up multiple warning messages (e.g., at 10 minutes, 5 minutes, and 1 minute)
- **Avoid frequent restarts**: Most servers only need 1-2 restarts per day
- **Document for players**: Let your community know about your restart schedule

## Game-Specific Recommendations

### Minecraft Servers

For Minecraft servers, a common schedule includes:
- A restart every 6-12 hours
- A memory cleanup command 30 minutes before restart
- Clear warning messages for players

### Valheim Servers

For Valheim servers:
- A restart every 24 hours is usually sufficient
- Use the broadcast command to warn players
- Consider scheduling during typical off-hours for your player base

### ARK: Survival Evolved

For ARK servers:
- Schedule restarts every 12 hours
- Always include a `save world` command before restarting
- Give players at least 15 minutes of warnings

## Troubleshooting Scheduled Tasks

### Schedule Not Running

If your schedule isn't running:
1. Verify the server is online (if you selected "Only When Server Is Online")
2. Check that the timing configuration is correct
3. Ensure the command syntax is appropriate for your game
4. Check server logs for errors

### Command Errors

If your scheduled command produces errors:
1. Test the command manually in the console first
2. Check server logs immediately after the scheduled time
3. Verify you're using the correct command format for your game version

# Importing Content from WordPress

This guide explains how to import content from your WordPress site into the XGamingServer documentation.

## Prerequisites

- A WordPress XML export file
- Linux/WSL environment with `xmlstarlet` installed
- Basic command line knowledge

## Step 1: Export WordPress Content

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Go to Tools > Export
3. Choose to export "All content"
4. Download the XML file

## Step 2: Run the Import Script

1. Place the WordPress XML export file in the same directory as the `import-from-wordpress.sh` script
2. Update the `WORDPRESS_EXPORT_FILE` variable in the script to match your export filename
3. Run the script:

```bash
chmod +x import-from-wordpress.sh
./import-from-wordpress.sh
```

## Step 3: Organize Imported Content

1. The script will create a `wordpress_content` directory with MDX files
2. Review each file and move it to the appropriate game directory
3. Rename files according to the guide structure (e.g., `setup.mdx`, `configuration.mdx`)
4. Update any internal links or image paths

## Step 4: Process Images

1. Download images from your WordPress site
2. Place them in the appropriate `images/games/[game-name]` directories
3. Update image references in MDX files from WordPress URL to local path

## Step 5: Test the Documentation

1. Run `mintlify dev` to preview the documentation
2. Check that all imported content displays correctly
3. Fix any formatting issues or broken links

# Why Was My Order Status Listed as Fraud

If your order has been flagged as potentially fraudulent, don't worry—this is a protective measure that can be resolved. This guide explains why orders get flagged, what it means, and how to get your order approved.

## Why Orders Get Flagged as Potential Fraud

XGamingServer uses an automated fraud detection system to protect both customers and our business. Orders may be flagged for various reasons:

### Common Flag Triggers

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Location Mismatch" icon="globe">
    Your IP address location differs significantly from your billing address
  </Card>
  <Card title="High-Risk Regions" icon="map-pin">
    Order placed from regions with historically high fraud rates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mismatched Information" icon="id-card">
    Discrepancies between provided information and payment provider data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Failed Attempts" icon="repeat">
    Several failed payment attempts before successful payment
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unusual Purchase Pattern" icon="chart-line">
    Order pattern differs from typical customer behavior
  </Card>
  <Card title="VPN/Proxy Usage" icon="mask">
    Order placed through VPN or proxy service
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Being flagged for fraud review does NOT mean we believe you are committing fraud. It's simply a security measure to verify legitimate orders and protect your payment information.
</Note>

## What Happens When an Order is Flagged

When an order is flagged for potential fraud:

1. **Order Status**: Your order status changes to "Fraud Review" in your client area
2. **Service Status**: Your server is not provisioned until the review is complete
3. **Notification**: You receive an email notification about the review
4. **Payment Hold**: Your payment is authorized but not fully processed
5. **Manual Review**: Our fraud prevention team reviews your order

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/fraud-review-status.jpg" alt="Fraud Review Status Example" />
</Frame>

## How to Resolve a Fraud Flag

If your order has been flagged for fraud review, here's how to get it resolved quickly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your email">
    Look for an email with the subject "Order Verification Required" in your inbox and spam folder. This email contains important information about next steps.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/fraud-email.jpg" alt="Fraud Review Email Example" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reply with verification">
    Respond to the verification email with the requested identification information, which may include:
    
    - A copy of your ID (driver's license, passport, or national ID)
    - A photo of the payment card used (showing only the last 4 digits)
    - A utility bill or bank statement showing your billing address
    
    <Info>
      For privacy, you can blur out or cover sensitive information not required for verification.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete verification form">
    In some cases, you may be directed to complete a secure verification form instead of sending documents via email.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for review">
    Our fraud prevention team will review your information, typically within 1-12 hours during business hours.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Order approval">
    Once verified, your order will be approved, and your server will be provisioned automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Expediting the Review Process

To get your order approved faster:

1. **Provide clear information**: Ensure all verification documents are clear and readable
2. **Respond quickly**: Prompt responses speed up the verification process
3. **Use official documents**: Government-issued IDs are preferred for verification
4. **Contact support**: If you haven't received a response within 24 hours, contact our support team

## Preventing Future Fraud Flags

To avoid having future orders flagged:

- **Use consistent information**: Ensure billing address matches your payment method's registered address
- **Disable VPN**: Turn off VPN or proxy services when placing orders
- **Verify payment details**: Double-check that all payment information is accurate
- **Use verified payment methods**: Previously verified payment methods are less likely to trigger flags
- **Update your profile**: Keep your account information current and accurate

## If Your Order Is Declined

In some cases, after review, an order may still be declined if:

- Verification documents could not be validated
- High-risk indicators could not be resolved
- Payment processor enforced restrictions
- Discrepancies could not be explained

If your legitimate order is declined, please contact our billing team directly at [billing@xgamingserver.com](mailto:billing@xgamingserver.com) with:

1. Your order number
2. A detailed explanation
3. Alternative payment method (if applicable)
4. Any additional verification you can provide

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will I be charged for an order under fraud review?">
    Your payment method will show an authorization hold, but you won't be charged until the order is approved. If the order is declined, the authorization is released.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does the verification process take?">
    Most verifications are completed within 1-12 hours during business hours. Complex cases may take up to 24 hours.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I place a new order instead of waiting for verification?">
    We recommend waiting for the verification process to complete. Creating multiple orders may trigger additional fraud flags.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is my personal information secure during verification?">
    Yes, all verification documents are handled according to our Privacy Policy, stored securely, and deleted after verification is complete.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# I Ordered Service and It Is Pending

If you've placed an order with XGamingServer and notice that it's in a "Pending" status, don't worry—this is a normal part of the order process in certain situations. This guide explains why orders may be pending and what steps you can take to resolve this status.

## Why Orders Show as Pending

There are several common reasons why an order might be in a pending status:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Payment Verification" icon="credit-card">
    Your payment method is being verified by our payment processor

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Understanding Order Statuses

XGamingServer uses several status labels to track orders:

| Status | Description | Typical Wait Time |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Pending | Order received but not yet processed | 5-30 minutes |
| Fraud Check | Order flagged for security verification | 1-12 hours |
| Processing | Order approved and being set up | 5-15 minutes |
| Active | Server is set up and ready to use | N/A |
| Failed | Order could not be processed | N/A |

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resolving a Pending Order

The steps to resolve a pending order depend on the reason for the pending status:

### For Payment Verification

Most payment verifications resolve automatically within 30 minutes. If your order has been pending for longer:

1. Check your email for any verification requests from our payment processor
2. Verify that your payment method has sufficient funds
3. Ensure your billing address matches the address on file with your payment provider

### For Manual Review Orders

If your order requires manual review:

1. Check your email for any requests for additional information
2. Respond promptly to any verification emails
3. Contact our billing team if you haven't received any communication within 12 hours

### For Resource Allocation Delays

Resource allocation typically happens automatically, but during high-demand periods:

1. Wait for the automated process to complete (usually within 30 minutes)
2. Check your order status occasionally for updates
3. Contact support if the status doesn't change after 1 hour

## Expediting Your Pending Order

If you need your server urgently, here are steps to expedite the process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for verification emails">
    First, check your email (including spam folder) for any verification requests that might be holding up your order.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Contact live support">
    Our live chat support can often check the status of your order in real-time and help resolve simple issues.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/live-chat-support.jpg" alt="Live Chat Support" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit a support ticket">
    If live chat is unavailable, submit a support ticket with your order number and a request for expedited processing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Try an alternative payment method">
    If payment issues are causing the delay, you can try placing a new order with a different payment method.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Frequently Asked Questions

# Suspensions and Terminations

This guide explains the difference between account suspensions and service terminations, why they occur, and what steps you can take to resolve these situations.

## Account Suspensions vs. Service Terminations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Account Suspension" icon="pause-circle">
    A temporary hold on your service due to payment issues or policy violations. Your data is preserved, and service can be restored.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Termination" icon="ban">
    Permanent closure of your service and deletion of all associated data. This typically follows extended suspension or serious policy violations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Accounts Get Suspended

Accounts may be suspended for several reasons:

### 1. Payment Issues

The most common reason for suspension is payment failure, which can occur due to:
- Expired credit card
- Insufficient funds
- Failed PayPal subscription
- Billing information errors
- Disputed charges or chargebacks

### 2. Terms of Service Violations

Violations that may lead to suspension include:
- Hosting prohibited content
- Server resource abuse
- Unauthorized penetration testing
- DDoS attacks originating from your server
- Using the service for illegal activities

### 3. Compliance Issues

Sometimes suspensions occur due to:
- Incomplete verification information
- Suspected fraudulent activity
- DMCA takedown notices
- Law enforcement requests

## The Suspension Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Warning notification">
    Before suspension, we attempt to notify you about impending issues via email. This is why keeping your contact information updated is crucial.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Service suspension">
    If the issue isn't resolved, your service will be suspended. During suspension:
    - Your server will be inaccessible
    - Control panel access is limited
    - Your data remains intact
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notification of suspension">
    We send an email explaining the reason for suspension and steps to resolve it.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/suspension-email.jpg" alt="Suspension Email Example" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolution period">
    You typically have 7-14 days to resolve the issue before the account moves toward termination. The exact timeframe depends on the nature of the suspension.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Resolving a Suspension

The steps to resolve a suspension depend on the reason:

### For Payment-Related Suspensions

1. Log in to your [billing dashboard](https://panel.xgamingserver.com/billing)
2. Navigate to Invoices > Unpaid
3. Review and pay any outstanding invoices
4. Update your payment method if necessary
5. Contact billing if you need assistance with payment

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/payment-update.jpg" alt="Update Payment Method" />
</Frame>

### For Policy Violation Suspensions

1. Review the suspension email for specific violation details
2. Address the violation by removing prohibited content or stopping the problematic activity
3. Contact support at [support@xgamingserver.com](mailto:support@xgamingserver.com) to explain the steps you've taken
4. Wait for account review (typically 24-48 hours)

## The Termination Process

Termination occurs when:
- A suspension isn't resolved within the given timeframe
- Multiple, repeated violations occur
- Severe terms of service violations are detected
- Account holder requests voluntary termination

<Warning>
  Termination results in the permanent deletion of all your server data, including world saves, configurations, and user data. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

The termination process typically follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Final notice">
    Before termination, we send a final notice giving you a last opportunity to resolve the issues.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Service termination">
    If no resolution occurs, the service is terminated and queued for data deletion.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data deletion">
    All server data is permanently deleted within 48-72 hours after termination.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Account closure">
    The account is marked as closed in our system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Appealing a Suspension or Termination

If you believe your account was suspended or terminated in error:

1. Gather any evidence supporting your appeal
2. Email our compliance team at [compliance@xgamingserver.com](mailto:compliance@xgamingserver.com)
3. Include your account ID and detailed explanation
4. Provide any relevant documentation
5. Allow 2-3 business days for review

## Preventative Measures

To avoid suspensions:

- Keep your payment information up to date
- Address warning emails promptly
- Review our Terms of Service regularly
- Monitor your server activity
- Respond to all official communications from XGamingServer
- Set up backup payment methods

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will I lose my data during a suspension?">
    No, your data is preserved during a suspension. However, you may not be able to access it until the suspension is resolved.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How quickly can my service be restored after resolving a suspension?">
    For payment-related suspensions, service is typically restored automatically within minutes after payment is received. For policy violations, it may take 24-48 hours for review and restoration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund if my account is terminated?">
    Refunds for terminated accounts are handled on a case-by-case basis according to our [refund policy](./refund-policy). In most cases, terminations due to policy violations are not eligible for refunds.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to my domain name if my service is terminated?">
    Custom domain names linked to your service will be unlinked upon termination. You retain ownership of the domain if you registered it separately.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Upgrading Your Service

As your server grows in popularity or your needs change, you may find that you need more resources. This guide explains how to upgrade your XGamingServer service to a higher plan.

## When to Upgrade Your Server

Consider upgrading your server if you're experiencing:

- **Performance issues**: Lag, slow loading times, or server crashes
- **Memory warnings**: Frequent "out of memory" errors in your logs
- **CPU bottlenecks**: High CPU usage consistently above 80%
- **Disk space limitations**: Running out of storage space
- **Player capacity issues**: Unable to accommodate your growing community

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/upgrade-indicators.jpg" alt="Server Resource Indicators" />
</Frame>

## Understanding Your Upgrade Options

XGamingServer offers several upgrade paths:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Vertical Scaling" icon="arrow-up">
    Increase RAM, CPU, and storage on your existing server
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add-On Services" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Add specific resources like extra RAM or storage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Premium Plans" icon="crown">
    Upgrade to premium tiers with additional features
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Solutions" icon="sliders">
    Tailor-made configurations for specific needs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to Upgrade Your Server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your account">
    Go to the [XGamingServer control panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com) and log in with your credentials.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to your services">
    Click on "Billing" in the main navigation, then select "Services" from the dropdown menu.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/billing-services-menu.jpg" alt="Billing Services Menu" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the server to upgrade">
    Locate the server you wish to upgrade and click the "Manage" button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access upgrade options">
    Look for the "Upgrade/Downgrade" or "Change Plan" button, typically located in the service details page.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/upgrade-button.jpg" alt="Upgrade Button" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select your new plan">
    Browse the available upgrade options and select the plan that best meets your needs. You'll see a comparison between your current plan and the selected upgrade.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/billing/plan-comparison.jpg" alt="Plan Comparison" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the upgrade details">
    Before confirming, review:
    - Price difference
    - New billing amount
    - Prorated charges (if applicable)
    - Resource changes
    - Effective date
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm and complete payment">
    Click the "Upgrade" button and complete any required payment for the upgrade. In many cases, you'll only pay the prorated difference between your current plan and the new plan.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Server upgrade process">
    After confirmation, your server will begin the upgrade process:
    1. You'll receive a confirmation email
    2. Your server may experience a brief downtime during the upgrade
    3. Once complete, your server will restart with the new resources
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Prorated Billing for Upgrades

When you upgrade mid-billing cycle, we calculate prorated charges to ensure you only pay for what you use:

1. You receive a credit for the unused portion of your current plan
2. You're charged for the new plan from the upgrade date until the end of your billing cycle

<Info>
  Prorated charges are calculated based on the number of days remaining in your current billing period. This ensures a fair and transparent upgrade process.
</Info>

### Example Calculation

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/billing/proration-example.jpg" alt="Proration Example" />
</Frame>

In this example:
- Current plan: $20/month
- New plan: $30/month
- 15 days remaining in billing cycle (out of 30 days)
- Credit for unused portion: $10 (50% of $20)
- Charge for new plan: $15 (50% of $30)
- Total prorated charge: $5 ($15 - $10)

## Upgrade FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will my server data be preserved during an upgrade?">
    Yes, all your server data, configurations, and game files are preserved during the upgrade process. However, we recommend creating a backup before any upgrade as a precaution.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does the upgrade process take?">
    Most upgrades are completed within 5-30 minutes, depending on the size of your server and the extent of the upgrade. During this time, your server may be temporarily unavailable.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I upgrade in the middle of my billing cycle?">
    Yes, you can upgrade at any time. We use prorated billing to ensure you only pay for the difference between your old and new plans for the remainder of your billing cycle.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I need to downgrade later?">
    Downgrades follow a similar process but are typically scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. See our [changing plans](./changing-plans) guide for more information.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Basic

### Inline Code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

```
To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
```

### Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

````md
```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

icon: 'image'
---

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/bigbend.jpg"
/>

## Image

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images using the following code

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/writing-content/embed) to add images

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

## Embeds and HTML elements

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
></iframe>

<br />

<Tip>

Mintlify supports [HTML tags in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html). This is helpful if you prefer HTML tags to Markdown syntax, and lets you create documentation with infinite flexibility.

</Tip>

### iFrames

Loads another HTML page within the document. Most commonly used for embedding videos.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"> </iframe>
```



================================================
FILE: essentials/markdown.mdx
================================================
---
title: 'Markdown Syntax'
description: 'Text, title, and styling in standard markdown'
icon: 'text-size'
---

## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```md
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best use to subsection headers.

```md
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right.

</Tip>

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### LaTeX

Mintlify supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) through the Latex component.

<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>

```md
<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>
```

FILE: essentials/navigation.mdx
================================================
---
title: 'Navigation'
description: 'The navigation field in docs.json defines the pages that go in the navigation menu'
icon: 'map'
---

The navigation menu is the list of links on every website.

You will likely update `docs.json` every time you add a new page. Pages do not show up automatically.

## Navigation syntax

Our navigation syntax is recursive which means you can make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<CodeGroup>

```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": ["quickstart"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```json Nested Navigation
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": [
            "quickstart",
            {
              "group": "Nested Reference Pages",
              "pages": ["nested-reference-page"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `docs.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>

You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside another folder. Mintlify uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api` folder for internal server calls. A folder name such as `api-reference` would be accepted.

</Warning>

```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Group Name",
          "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Hidden Pages

MDX files not included in `docs.json` will not show up in the sidebar but are accessible through the search bar and by linking directly to them.

title: Reusable Snippets
description: Reusable, custom snippets to keep content in sync
icon: 'recycle'
---

import SnippetIntro from '/snippets/snippet-intro.mdx';

<SnippetIntro />

## Creating a custom snippet

**Pre-condition**: You must create your snippet file in the `snippets` directory.

<Note>
  Any page in the `snippets` directory will be treated as a snippet and will not
  be rendered into a standalone page. If you want to create a standalone page
  from the snippet, import the snippet into another file and call it as a
  component.
</Note>

### Default export

1. Add content to your snippet file that you want to re-use across multiple
   locations. Optionally, you can add variables that can be filled in via props
   when you import the snippet.

```mdx snippets/my-snippet.mdx
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages. My keyword of the
day is {word}.
```

<Warning>
  The content that you want to reuse must be inside the `snippets` directory in
  order for the import to work.
</Warning>

2. Import the snippet into your destination file.

```mdx destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet word="bananas" />
```

### Reusable variables

1. Export a variable from your snippet file:

```mdx snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx
export const myName = 'my name';

export const myObject = { fruit: 'strawberries' };
```

2. Import the snippet from your destination file and use the variable:

```mdx destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { myName, myObject } from '/snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx';

Hello, my name is {myName} and I like {myObject.fruit}.
```

### Reusable components

1. Inside your snippet file, create a component that takes in props by exporting
   your component in the form of an arrow function.

```mdx snippets/custom-component.mdx
export const MyComponent = ({ title }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>... snippet content ...</p>
  </div>
);
```

<Warning>
  MDX does not compile inside the body of an arrow function. Stick to HTML
  syntax when you can or use a default export if you need to use MDX.
</Warning>

2. Import the snippet into your destination file and pass in the props

```mdx destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { MyComponent } from '/snippets/custom-component.mdx';

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<MyComponent title={'Custom title'} />
```

# Setting Up Automatic Server Backups

Regular backups are crucial for protecting your game server data. This guide explains how to set up, manage, and restore backups using the XGamingServer control panel.

## Backup System Overview

The XGamingServer backup system allows you to:
- Create manual backups at any time
- Schedule automatic backups at regular intervals
- Download backups to your local computer
- Restore backups to your server
- Configure backup rotation policies

## Creating Manual Backups

To create a backup immediately:

1. Log in to your [XGamingServer control panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com)
2. Select your game server
3. Navigate to the **Backups** tab
4. Click the **Create Backup** button
5. Enter an optional name for your backup (recommended for easy identification)
6. Select which folders/files to include
7. Click **Create Backup**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/game-panel/create-backup.jpg" alt="Creating a Manual Backup" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Creating a backup may temporarily increase server load. For large servers, we recommend scheduling backups during low-activity periods.
</Note>

## Setting Up Scheduled Backups

To set up automatic backups:

1. Go to the **Schedules** tab in your server's control panel
2. Click **Create Schedule**
3. Select **Backup** as the task type
4. Configure the following settings:
   - **Name**: Give your backup schedule a descriptive name
   - **Frequency**: Choose how often the backup should run
   - **First Run**: Set when the first backup should occur
   - **Files to backup**: Select which directories to include
   - **Backup retention**: How many backups to keep before rotation

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/game-panel/scheduled-backup.jpg" alt="Configuring Scheduled Backups" />
</Frame>

### Recommended Backup Frequencies

| Server Type | Recommended Frequency | Retention |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Low activity | Weekly | 4 backups |
| Medium activity | Twice weekly | 6 backups |
| High activity | Daily | 7 backups |
| Mission critical | Twice daily | 10 backups |

## Managing Your Backups

All your backups are listed in the **Backups** tab. For each backup, you can:

- **Download**: Save the backup to your local computer
- **Restore**: Restore this backup to your server
- **Lock**: Prevent the backup from being automatically deleted during rotation
- **Delete**: Permanently remove the backup

<Warning>
  Restoring a backup will overwrite existing files on your server. Make sure you have a backup of your current state before restoring an older backup.
</Warning>

## Backup Rotation

Backup rotation helps manage storage space by automatically removing old backups. Here's how it works:

1. You set the maximum number of backups to keep (retention policy)
2. When this limit is reached, the oldest unlocked backup is deleted
3. Locked backups are never automatically deleted

To lock an important backup:
1. Go to the **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup you want to protect
3. Click the **Lock** icon

<Tip>
  Lock important backups like those taken before major updates or significant server changes.
</Tip>

## Restoring From a Backup

To restore your server from a backup:

1. Go to the **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup you want to restore
3. Click the **Restore** button
4. Confirm the restoration

<Warning>
  Restoring a backup will stop your server during the process. Players will be disconnected until the restoration is complete and the server is restarted.
</Warning>

The restoration process:
1. Stops the game server
2. Extracts the backup
3. Replaces the current files with the backup files
4. Restarts the server (if it was running before)

## Downloading Backups

To download a backup to your computer:

1. Go to the **Backups** tab
2. Find the backup you want to download
3. Click the **Download** button
4. Save the file to your preferred location

<Note>
  Backups are compressed archives. You'll need a program like 7-Zip, WinRAR, or a similar utility to extract them.
</Note>

## Best Practices for Server Backups

- **Multiple backup schedules**: Consider having both daily and weekly backup schedules
- **Test your backups**: Periodically restore a backup in a test environment to ensure it works
- **External storage**: Download important backups to your local computer for extra safety
- **Document changes**: Add notes to your backups describing major server changes
- **Pre-update backups**: Always create a backup before installing updates or making significant changes

## Troubleshooting Backup Issues

### Backup Creation Fails

If your backup fails to create:
1. Check if you have sufficient storage space on your server plan
2. Ensure the server isn't experiencing excessive load
3. Try creating a backup with fewer files/directories
4. Contact support if the issue persists

### Backup Restoration Fails

If your backup fails to restore:
1. Verify the backup file isn't corrupted
2. Check server logs for specific error messages
3. Ensure you have sufficient storage space for the restored files
4. Try restarting the server before attempting restoration again

# How to Create Schedules on XGamingServer

Whether you want to restart your server every night, run a backup, or execute a custom command at a specific time — **Schedules** make that magic happen. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating schedules in your XGamingServer panel.

---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into the Panel">
    1. Go to [panel.xgamingserver.com](https://panel.xgamingserver.com)
    2. Log in with your credentials.
    3. Click on your **server** to open its dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Schedule Section">
    1. On the top bar, click **Schedules**.
    2. Hit the **Create Schedule** button.

    ![Screenshot2025 04 07123337 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-07123337.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Your Schedule">
    ![image.png](/image.png)

    Fill in the required fields:

    - **Schedule Name**: e.g. `Daily Restart`
    - **Enabled**: Toggle ON to activate immediately
    - **Only When Online**: Optional — use if schedule should only run while the server is online
    - **Cronjob Time**: Input the CRON expression that defines when the task runs

    > 💡 Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) if you're new to CRON syntax.

    Example for daily at 3AM: `0 3 * * *`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tasks">
    ![image.png](/image.png)

    Once the schedule is created, you'll be taken to the **task list**.

    1. Click **"New Task"**.
    2. Choose an **action**:
       - `Send Power Action` – e.g., restart, stop, start
       - `Send Command` – run a specific command
       - `Create Backup` – (if backup is available for your server)
    3. Set a **Delay (in seconds)** — if you want it to wait a bit before running. For example:
       - Task 1: Stop server (0 sec)
       - Task 2: Start server (10 sec)
    4. Click **"Create Task"**.

    💡 _Tip: For a daily restart, create two tasks: Stop → Start, with 10–30s delay between them._

    ![image.png](/image.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Wait">
    That’s it\! The schedule will now run according to the CRON time you set. You can always:

    - **Edit** the schedule or tasks.
    - **Enable/disable** schedules.
    - **Manually run** the schedule with the ▶️ button if you want to test it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Common Examples

| Task                 | CRON           | Description                   |
| :------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Daily restart at 3AM | `0 3 * * *`    | Stops and starts server daily |
| Every 6 hours        | `0 */6 * * *`  | Runs every 6 hours            |
| Every Friday at 10PM | `0 22 * * 5`   | Weekly Friday night task      |
| Every 15 mins        | `*/15 * * * *` | For fast auto-tasks           |

# Schedule Examples and What You Can Do

Schedules on XGamingServer give you powerful automation — from server restarts to running backups or even sending commands in-game. Below are real-world examples and use cases to inspire how you can use them effectively.

## Auto Restart Server

Keeping your server fresh and lag-free is easy with a daily restart.

- **CRON**: `0 4 * * *`
- **Task 1**: Send Power Action → Stop (0s delay)
- **Task 2**: Send Power Action → Start (30s delay)
- **Use Case**: Restart server daily at 4AM when no one is online.

## Automated Backups

Take daily or weekly backups to avoid losing progress.

- **CRON**: `0 2 * * *`
- **Task**: Create Backup (0s delay)
- **Use Case**: Daily backup at 2AM. Make sure you're on a plan that supports this feature.

## in-Game Warning \+ Restart

Send players a warning before kicking them for a restart.

- **CRON**: `0 5 * * *`
- **Task 1**: Send Command `say Server will restart in 1 minute!` (0s delay)
- **Task 2**: Send Power Action → Restart (60s delay)
- **Use Case**: Restart server every morning with player notification.

## Auto-Clear In-Game Items

Run cleanup commands on sandbox games (like Minecraft or Rust).

- **CRON**: `*/30 * * * *`
- **Task**: Send Command `/clearitems` or your game’s equivalent (0s delay)
- **Use Case**: Prevent item lag by auto-clearing dropped items every 30 minutes.

## Schedule Server Downtime

Want the server offline during certain hours?

- **Schedule 1 (Stop)**: CRON: `0 0 * * *` → Task: Send Power Action → Stop (0s delay)
- **Schedule 2 (Start)**: CRON: `0 6 * * *` → Task: Send Power Action → Start (0s delay)
- **Use Case**: Keep server offline from midnight to 6AM to reduce load or enforce offline hours. (Requires two separate schedules)

## Reset PvP Zones or Events

Automate in-game events that reset maps or PvP zones.

- **CRON**: `0 */6 * * *`
- **Task**: Send Command `/resetarena` (0s delay)
- **Use Case**: Reset event zones every 6 hours in survival or competitive servers.

## Pro Tips

- Use `Send Command` to run mods/scripts or custom cleanup
- Combine multiple tasks for multi-step automation
- Use `Only When Online` toggle to avoid unnecessary runs
- Adjust delays carefully to avoid overlapping actions

## Advanced Setup

Want to do something really specific like:

- Auto-switch game modes?
- Change configs via command?
- Rotate maps or mods?
  Yes, you can schedule those too — as long as your game supports commands/scripts to trigger them. Just schedule them using the **Send Command** action.

# Security Best Practices  

Securing your server is critical to protect it from unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious attacks. This guide outlines best practices for securing your XGamingServer instance on the Pterodactyl Panel.  

---

## Overview  

The **Pterodactyl Panel** provides robust tools to manage your game servers securely. However, server security also depends on proactive measures taken by you and your subusers. Follow these best practices to minimize risks and ensure a safe hosting environment.  

---

## 1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)  

### Why It's Important  
Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code from an authenticator app) in addition to your password.  

### Steps to Enable 2FA  
1. Log in to the Pterodactyl Panel.  
2. Navigate to your account settings.  
3. Enable 2FA using an app like Google Authenticator or Authy.  
4. Save the recovery codes in a secure location.  

<Callout type="warning">  
Never share your recovery codes with anyone. They can be used to bypass 2FA if your device is lost or stolen.  
</Callout>  

---

## 2. Use Strong Passwords  

### Why It's Important  
Weak passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks. A strong password reduces the risk of unauthorized access.  

### Tips for Strong Passwords  
- Use at least 12 characters.  
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
- Avoid common words, phrases, or patterns.  
- Use a password manager to generate and store unique passwords.  

---

## 3. Secure Subuser Permissions  

### Why It's Important  
Subusers with excessive permissions can accidentally or intentionally cause harm. Limit their access to only what they need.  

### Best Practices  
- Assign the **least privilege** necessary for each subuser’s role.  
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary subuser accounts.  
- Require subusers to enable 2FA on their accounts.  

<Callout type="info">  
For example, a moderator might only need **Console Access**, while a developer might need **File Management** and **Backup Management**.  
</Callout>  

---

## 4. Keep Software Updated  

### Why It's Important  
Outdated software (e.g., game servers, plugins, mods) may contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.  

### Steps to Stay Updated  
- Regularly check for updates to your game server software.  
- Update plugins/mods to their latest versions.  
- Monitor community forums or changelogs for security patches.  

<Callout type="tip">  
Automate updates where possible, but test them in a staging environment first to avoid breaking changes.  
</Callout>  

---

## 5. Protect Against DDoS Attacks  

### Why It's Important  
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks overwhelm your server with traffic, causing downtime.  

### Mitigation Strategies  
- Use a hosting provider with built-in DDoS protection (e.g., OVH, Hetzner).  
- Enable Cloudflare or another CDN to absorb malicious traffic.  
- Configure rate-limiting rules on your firewall to block excessive requests.  

<Callout type="warning">  
If you experience a DDoS attack, contact your hosting provider immediately for assistance.  
</Callout>  

---

## 6. Secure Network Configuration  

### Why It's Important  
Improper network settings can expose your server to external threats.  

### Best Practices  
- Open only the ports required for your server (e.g., game traffic, RCON).  
- Avoid exposing sensitive services (e.g., SSH, database ports) to the public internet.  
- Use firewalls to restrict access to trusted IP addresses.  

<Callout type="info">  
Refer to our [Adding Additional Server Ports](/guides/additional-server-ports) guide for instructions on managing ports.  
</Callout>  

---

## 7. Regularly Back Up Your Server  

### Why It's Important  
Backups allow you to recover quickly from data loss, corruption, or ransomware attacks.  

### Backup Strategies  
- Schedule automatic backups daily or weekly.  
- Store backups in a secure, off-site location (e.g., cloud storage).  
- Test restoring backups periodically to ensure they work.  

<Callout type="tip">  
Use the Pterodactyl Panel’s built-in backup tools or third-party solutions for additional redundancy.  
</Callout>  

---

## 8. Monitor Logs and Activity  

### Why It's Important  
Logs provide insights into server activity and help detect suspicious behavior.  

### Steps to Monitor Logs  
- Check live logs in the Pterodactyl Panel regularly.  
- Look for unusual login attempts, commands, or errors.  
- Set up alerts for critical events (if supported by your hosting provider).  

<Callout type="info">  
For example, repeated failed login attempts may indicate a brute-force attack.  
</Callout>  

---

## 9. Secure File Uploads  

### Why It's Important  
Malicious files uploaded to your server can compromise its security.  

### Best Practices  
- Restrict file uploads to trusted users only.  
- Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus tools.  
- Avoid running untrusted plugins/mods unless they’re from reputable sources.  

---

## 10. Educate Your Team  

### Why It's Important  
Even the best security measures can fail if your team isn’t aware of best practices.  

### Training Tips  
- Teach subusers about phishing attacks and social engineering.  
- Emphasize the importance of strong passwords and 2FA.  
- Provide clear guidelines for handling sensitive data.  

---

## Troubleshooting Security Issues  

### Issue: Unauthorized Access Detected  
- **Cause**: Weak passwords, missing 2FA, or compromised credentials.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Change all passwords immediately.  
  2. Enable 2FA for all accounts.  
  3. Review subuser permissions and remove suspicious accounts.  

### Issue: Server Crashes After Plugin/Mod Update  
- **Cause**: Incompatible or malicious plugin/mod.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Roll back to the previous version using backups.  
  2. Verify the plugin/mod source before reinstalling.  

### Issue: Excessive Traffic or Downtime  
- **Cause**: Potential DDoS attack.  
- **Solution**:  
  1. Contact your hosting provider for mitigation.  
  2. Enable additional protection (e.g., Cloudflare).

title: "Managing Users and Subusers"
---

Learn how to add, configure, and manage subusers for your XGamingServer instance in the Pterodactyl Panel. This guide will help you delegate access securely while maintaining control over your server.

---

## Overview

The **Pterodactyl Panel** allows server owners to collaborate with others by adding **subusers**. Subusers are secondary accounts that can be granted limited permissions to perform specific tasks (e.g., managing files, sending console commands).

### Key Concepts

- **Primary User**: The account that created the server. It has full administrative access.
- **Subusers**: Additional users invited by the primary user. They have restricted access based on assigned permissions.

<info>
  Subusers are ideal for delegating responsibilities to trusted admins or friends without sharing your primary account credentials.
</info>

---

## Adding a Subuser

### Step 1: Access Subuser Settings

1. Log in to the [Pterodactyl Panel](https://your-ptero-domain.com).
2. Select the server you want to manage from the server list.
3. Navigate to the **Subusers** tab in the server dashboard.

### Step 2: Invite a Subuser

1. Enter the **email address** of the user you want to invite.
   - Ensure the email matches their Pterodactyl account.
2. Assign permissions (see [Permission Levels](#permission-levels) below).
3. Click **Create Subuser** to send the invitation.

<warning>
  The invited user must already have a Pterodactyl account registered with the same email address. If they don’t, ask them to create one before proceeding.
</warning>

---

## Permission Levels

When inviting a subuser, you can assign specific permissions. Below is a detailed breakdown of each permission and its use cases:

| Permission            | Description                               | Use Case Examples                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Console Access**    | View/send commands to the server console. | Admins who need to run game commands.                           |
| **Start/Stop**        | Control server power state.               | Moderators who restart the server after crashes.                |
| **File Management**   | Edit, upload, or delete server files.     | Developers managing plugins/mods/configs.                       |
| **Backup Management** | Create/restore backups.                   | Backup operators ensuring data safety.                          |
| **User Management**   | Add/remove other subusers.                | Rarely recommended; avoid granting unless absolutely necessary. |

<info>
  Grant only the permissions necessary for the subuser’s role. For example, a moderator might need **Console Access** but not **File Management**.
</info>

---

## Editing Permissions

If you need to adjust a subuser’s permissions:

### Step 1: Locate the Subuser

1. Go to the **Subusers** tab in the server dashboard.
2. Find the subuser you want to modify.

### Step 2: Modify Permissions

1. Click **Edit** next to the subuser.
2. Adjust their permissions as needed.
3. Save changes.

<tip>
  Changes take effect immediately. There’s no need to log out or restart the server.
</tip>

---

## Removing a Subuser

If a subuser no longer needs access to your server:

### Step 1: Locate the Subuser

1. Go to the **Subusers** tab in the server dashboard.
2. Find the subuser you want to remove.

### Step 2: Delete the Subuser

1. Click **Delete** next to the subuser.
2. Confirm the action when prompted.

<warning>
  Removing a subuser revokes all access immediately. Ensure this is intentional, as the subuser will no longer be able to interact with your server.
</warning>

---

## Best Practices

To ensure secure and efficient subuser management, follow these guidelines:

### 1. **Principle of Least Privilege**

- Only grant permissions necessary for the subuser’s role. For example:
  - A moderator might need **Console Access** but not **File Management**.
  - A developer might need **File Management** but not **User Management**.

### 2. **Regular Audits**

- Periodically review your subusers and their permissions.
- Remove inactive or unnecessary subusers.

### 3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

- Require subusers to enable 2FA on their accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

### 4. **Avoid Sharing Primary Credentials**

- Never share your primary account credentials with others. Always use subusers for delegation.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Subuser Not Receiving Invitation

- **Cause**: The email may not match their Pterodactyl account, or the invitation email was filtered as spam.
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify the email matches their Pterodactyl account.
  2. Ask the subuser to check their spam/junk folder.
  3. Resend the invitation if necessary.

### Issue: Subuser Lacks Expected Access

- **Cause**: Incorrect permissions were assigned during setup.
- **Solution**:
  1. Go to the **Subusers** tab.
  2. Edit the subuser’s permissions and ensure all required permissions are enabled.

### Issue: Subuser Cannot Log In

- **Cause**: The subuser’s Pterodactyl account may be inactive or locked.
- **Solution**:
  1. Ask the subuser to verify their account status.
  2. Ensure they can log in to the Pterodactyl Panel independently.

---

## Advanced Use Cases

### 1. **Multi-Admin Servers**

For servers with multiple admins, assign roles based on responsibilities:

- **Lead Admin**: Full access except **User Management**.
- **Moderator**: Console Access and Start/Stop permissions.
- **Developer**: File Management and Backup Management.

### 2. **Event-Based Access**

Grant temporary access to subusers for specific events (e.g., tournaments):

1. Add the subuser before the event.
2. Remove the subuser after the event concludes.

### 3. **Automated Monitoring**

Use subusers with limited permissions (e.g., **Console Access**) to monitor server health via third-party tools.

# Valheim Server Setup

Setting up your Valheim server on XGamingServer is quick and easy. Follow these steps to get started with your Viking adventure.

## Creating Your Server

1. Log in to your [XGamingServer control panel](https://panel.xgamingserver.com)
2. Click the **Create Server** button
3. Select **Valheim** from the game list
4. Choose your server plan based on your needs:

| Plan | RAM | CPU | Storage | Recommended Players |
|------|-----|-----|---------|---------------------|
| Basic | 4GB | 2 cores | 10GB | 1-5 |
| Standard | 8GB | 4 cores | 20GB | 5-10 |
| Premium | 16GB | 6 cores | 40GB | 10+ |

5. Select your server location (choosing a location close to your players will reduce latency)
6. Enter your server name, world name, and password
7. Click **Create Server**

Your server will be ready in a few minutes.

## Initial Configuration

Once your server is created, you'll need to configure some basic settings:

1. Navigate to the **Startup** tab in your server control panel
2. Configure the following settings:
   - **Server Name**: The name displayed in the server browser
   - **World Name**: Name of your world file (this is important for backups)
   - **Server Password**: Required for players to join (minimum 5 characters)
   - **Public**: Whether your server is visible in the public server list

<Note>
For security reasons, we strongly recommend setting a password for your Valheim server.
</Note>

## Connecting to Your Server

Players can connect to your Valheim server in two ways:

### In-Game Server Browser

1. Launch Valheim
2. Select **Join Game**
3. Click the **Join by IP** button  
4. Enter your server address: `your-server-ip:2456`
5. Enter the password when prompted

### Steam Server Browser

1. In Steam, go to **View** > **Servers**
2. Click the **Favorites** tab
3. Click **Add a Server**
4. Enter your server address: `your-server-ip:2456`
5. Your server will appear in your favorites list
6. Double-click to connect
7. Enter the password when prompted

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself). This is a principle that apply to documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.
