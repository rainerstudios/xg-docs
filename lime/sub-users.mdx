Perhaps you have server admins who you want to be able to access server files
but not allow them to change the server settings. Or maybe you want to give a
friend complete access to the server. This could be done by adding a sub-user to
your server.

## Adding a subuser

On the "Users" tab on the [Lime](/lime/overview) panel, click the **Add User**
button. You will be presented with a form to add a new user. You can also limit
access by selecting what permissions you want them to have access to. Below is a
visual example.

Once added, the user will be added to your server and their credentials will be
sent via email. If they haven't gotten any email, ask them to reset their
password by going through the "Forgot Password" steps.

You'll be able to manage their permissions or revoke them at any time. Their
actions are also logged on the "Activity" tab where you can view what changes or
their activity on the panel.

Feel free to make a [ticket](https://berrybyte.net/ticket) or ask in our
[Discord server](https://berrybyte.net/discord), if you have any questions.
