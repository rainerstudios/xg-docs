# Using the Console

The Console is the most direct way to interact with your game server. It shows you the live activity of your server's software and allows you to send commands in real-time.

## Understanding the Interface

When you open the Console page, you'll see several key areas:

### Live Output
The main window is a scrolling log of your server's activity. This is where you'll see:
- Chat messages from players
- Server events (player joins/leaves, world saves, etc.)
- Error messages and warnings
- Plugin/mod outputs
- System notifications

### Resource Graphs
At the top, you'll find live graphs showing your server's performance:
- **CPU Usage** - Processing power being used
- **RAM Usage** - Memory consumption
- **Network Activity** - Data transfer rates

These graphs update every 10 seconds when the server is running and are great for monitoring the health and performance of your server at a glance.

### Server Information Panel
The right side shows detailed server information:
- **Address**: Shows server IP and port (e.g., 178.156.160.221:2456)
- **Uptime**: Displays how long server has been running
- **Disk Space**: Available storage remaining
- **Network Activity**: Real-time inbound/outbound traffic

### Power Controls
The power buttons control your server's state:
- **Start** - Boots up your server
- **Stop** - Gracefully shuts down the server
- **Restart** - Stops and starts the server
- **Kill** - Forces the server to stop immediately (use sparingly)

<Warning>
Use the **Kill** button only when your server is unresponsive. It may cause data loss or corruption.
</Warning>

### Command Input
The text box at the bottom is where you type commands to send to your server.

## Sending Commands

To send a command, simply type it into the input box and press `Enter`.

### Example Commands by Game:

## Useful Console Features

### Command History
You can quickly access commands you've recently used:
1. Click in the command input box
2. Press the `↑` (Up Arrow) key to cycle through previous commands
3. Press the `↓` (Down Arrow) key to go forward in your command history

### Search Console Output
Need to find a specific event or message?
1. Press `Ctrl+F` (or `Cmd+F` on Mac) to open the search bar
2. Type your search term
3. The console will highlight matching text

### Copy Server Logs
If you need to share your server logs for support:
1. Click the **Clipboard icon** in the console toolbar
2. This copies the last 500 lines of logs
3. The logs are automatically uploaded to a sharing service
4. The shareable link is copied to your clipboard

### Pop-out Console
Click the **Expand icon** to open the console in a new browser window. This is useful for:
