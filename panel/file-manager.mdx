# Managing Files

The File Manager allows you to work with all of your server's files directly from your web browser, just like using File Explorer on Windows or Finder on macOS. No need for FTP clients or command-line access!

## Navigating Your Server Files

### Understanding the Interface
- **File List** - Shows all files and folders in the current directory
- **Breadcrumbs** - Navigation trail at the top showing your current location
- **Action Buttons** - Tools for creating, uploading, and managing files
- **Context Menus** - Right-click or three-dots menu for file operations

### Moving Around Directories
- **Enter Folders** - Click on any folder name to open it
- **Go Back** - Use the breadcrumb navigation at the top
- **Home Directory** - Click the server name to return to the root folder

## Common File Management Tasks

### Uploading Server Files

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Target Directory">
    Use the file browser to go to where you want to upload files
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Upload">
    Select the Upload button in the top toolbar
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Files">
    Either click to browse files or drag-and-drop directly into the upload window
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Watch the upload progress bar and wait for completion
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Installing Mods or Plugins

Many mods and plugins come as `.zip` files:

1. **Upload** the `.zip` file to your server
2. **Right-click** the uploaded file
3. **Select "Decompress"** to extract the contents
4. **Move files** to the appropriate directories (usually `mods/` or `plugins/`)
5. **Delete** the original `.zip` file to save space

### Editing Configuration Files

Server configuration files (like `server.properties`, `config.yml`) can be edited directly:

1. **Navigate** to the configuration file
2. **Right-click** and select **"Edit"**
3. **Make changes** using the built-in code editor
4. **Save** your changes (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
5. **Restart** your server to apply the new settings

## Troubleshooting File Issues

### Upload Problems
- **Large Files**: Break down large uploads into smaller chunks
- **Connection Issues**: Check your internet connection and try again
- **File Permissions**: Some files may require server restart after upload

### Editor Issues  
- **File Won't Save**: Check if the server has sufficient disk space
- **Syntax Errors**: Use the editor's error highlighting to identify issues
- **Encoding Problems**: Ensure files use UTF-8 encoding for special characters

### Performance Tips
- **Limit Concurrent Operations**: Avoid running multiple heavy file operations simultaneously
- **Use Archives**: Compress large directories before downloading
- **Clear Browser Cache**: If the interface becomes slow or unresponsive
