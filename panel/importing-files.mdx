## Web upload

<Info>This method of upload is limited to **100MB**.</Info>

To directly upload files to the panel, you can head to the **File Manager** tab,
and drag-and-drop the files to the screen.

When trying to directly upload a folder to the file manager, you will encounter an error that reads: `Failed to get multipart form data from request`.
You will need to archive the folder using a tool like [7Zip](https://7zip.org) or [WinRAR](https://winrar.org) and upload it that way.
Once uploaded, you can press the three dots and press the **Unarchive** button.

### The following archive types are supported:

- .zip
- .7z
- .tar.gz

## Server importer

<Info>This method of upload does **not** have a size limitation.</Info>

On the panel, we've built in a tool to import your server's files from another
host or server directly into the panel. This tool is located in the **File
Manager** tab, and is the **Import Files** button. Refer to the GIF below for a
visual example.

There, you can fill in the fields with the details of the SFTP/FTP/FTPS
credentials from your old host. Normally, the base directory can be left as
default for most users, unless you only want to import a specific folder. For
example, if you only want to import the `plugins` folder, you would fill the
field as `/plugins` and the panel will disregard all other files except for that
specific folder.

Once you've filled in the fields, you can press the **Import Files** button.
This will import all of your server's files, like your server's configuration
files, such as the `server.properties` file, and your server's plugins, and
worlds (unless you specified otherwise).

## Importing via SFTP

<Info>This method of upload does **not** have a size limitation.</Info>

[SFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol) is a secure way
to transfer files from your computer to the panel. This is a great way to upload
your server's files to the panel, and is the recommended way to upload your
server's files especially if the files are stored on your computer, or if the
files are larger than 100MB.

1. Download a SFTP client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)
   (recommended) or [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org).
2. Once installed, head to the **Settings** tab, and press the **Launch SFTP**
   button.
3. You will be prompted with a window to enter your SFTP password, it will be
   the same password used to log in to the control panel.
4. Locate the files/directories on your computer that you want to transfer, and
   drag-and-drop them into the window of your FTP client. This will upload the
   files to the panel and a rough ETA (estimated time of arrival) will be
   displayed normally at the bottom of the screen.

The speed of the transfer may seem significantly low, however in most cases that is due to importing hundreds (sometimes even thousands!) of several smaller files rather than one big file.

<Tip>To speed up the SFTP import, archive your files into any one of the [supported archive types](#the-following-archive-types-are-supported). Then, transfer that archive through SFTP and [unarchive](/lime/unarchiving) it on the panel directly.</Tip>

## Download files from a URL

<Info>This method of upload does **not** have a size limitation.</Info>

You can also download files from a URL directly into the panel. This is a great
way to download a plugin, a resource pack or a server JAR from a website and
upload it directly into the panel.

1. Head to the **File Manager** tab, and press the **Download from URL** button.
2. You will be prompted with a window to enter the URL of the file you want to
   download. You can also enter the name of the file you want to download, and
   the location you want to download it to.
3. Once you've filled in the fields, you can press the **Download** button. This
   will download the file from the URL, and upload it to the panel.
