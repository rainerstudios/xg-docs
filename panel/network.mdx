The Network tab controls all networking aspects of your game server, including port allocations, subdomain management, and traffic monitoring.

## Overview

Network configuration ensures your server is properly accessible to players and external tools. You can manage:

- **Primary Allocation** - Your server's main IP and port
- **Additional Ports** - Extra ports for plugins, web panels, or RCON
- **Subdomains** - Custom domains for easier player access
- **Network Statistics** - Real-time traffic monitoring

<Info>
Network changes may temporarily disconnect active players. Plan changes during low-traffic periods when possible.
</Info>

## Primary Allocation

Your server's primary allocation is automatically assigned during setup and includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="IP Address" icon="globe">
    **Example**: `178.156.160.221`
    
    The public IP address players use to connect to your server
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Port Number" icon="hashtag">
    **Example**: `25565` (Minecraft default)
    
    The specific port your game server listens on
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Changing your primary allocation may require players to update their connection details and could affect existing bookmarks.
</Warning>

    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField path="Domain" type="string" default="Auto-filled">
      The base domain provided by XGamingServer
      
      **Example**: `dedicatedminecraft.host`
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField path="Allocation" type="select" required>
      Select which port allocation this subdomain should point to
    </ParamField>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="DNS Propagation">
    Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS changes to propagate globally
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Verify players can connect using the new subdomain
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Subdomain Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Use clear, game-relevant subdomain names:
    - `survival.yourdomain.host`
    - `creative.yourdomain.host`  
    - `lobby.yourdomain.host`
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Consistent Branding" icon="palette">
    Maintain consistent naming across your server network:
    - `mc-survival.host`
    - `mc-creative.host`
    - `mc-events.host`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Network Monitoring

### Traffic Statistics

The Network tab displays real-time network usage:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Current Session" icon="activity">
    - **Bytes In**: Data received by your server
    - **Bytes Out**: Data sent by your server  
    - **Active Connections**: Current player connections
    - **Peak Concurrent**: Highest simultaneous connections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Historical Data" icon="chart-area">
    - **24-hour trends**: Traffic patterns over the past day
    - **Weekly overview**: Bandwidth usage across the week
    - **Monthly totals**: Cumulative data transfer statistics
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Understanding Network Usage

<Tip>
High outbound traffic often indicates:
- Large world downloads (new players joining)
- Frequent chunk loading (players exploring)  
- Plugin data synchronization
- Automatic backups or file transfers
</Tip>

## Port Security & Firewall

### Default Security Measures

XGamingServer automatically provides:

- **DDoS Protection** - Filters malicious traffic
- **Port Isolation** - Each allocation is independently secured
- **Access Logging** - Connection attempts are recorded
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevents connection flooding

### Manual Security Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Open Ports">
    Regularly audit your port allocations and close unused ones
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Connection Logs">
    Check the Activity tab for suspicious connection patterns
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Strong Authentication">
    Enable passwords/whitelisting for sensitive ports (RCON, web panels)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Network Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot Connect to Server" icon="plug-circle-exclamation">
    **Common Causes**:
    - Server is offline or starting up
    - Incorrect IP address or port
    - Firewall blocking the connection
    - DNS propagation still in progress (for subdomains)
    
    **Solutions**:
    1. Verify server is running in the Console tab
    2. Double-check connection details
    3. Try connecting via IP address instead of subdomain
    4. Wait 30 minutes for DNS updates to complete
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Port Already in Use" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Problem**: Error when creating new port allocation
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Choose a different port number
    - Check if another service is using the port
    - Review existing allocations for conflicts
    - Contact support if the port should be available
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Network Usage" icon="gauge-high">
    **Problem**: Unexpected bandwidth consumption
    
    **Investigation Steps**:
    1. Check for DDoS attacks in activity logs
    2. Review recent plugin installations
    3. Monitor player activity for unusual patterns
    4. Inspect backup/sync processes
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Implement connection rate limiting
    - Optimize plugin configurations
    - Schedule data-intensive tasks during off-peak hours
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subdomain Not Working" icon="globe-slash">
    **Problem**: Players can't connect via custom subdomain
    
    **Troubleshooting**:
    1. Confirm subdomain points to correct allocation
    2. Test direct IP connection to isolate DNS issues
    3. Use `nslookup` or `dig` to verify DNS resolution
    4. Wait additional time for global DNS propagation
    
    **DNS Testing Commands**:
    ```bash
    # Windows/Linux
    nslookup your-subdomain.host
    
    # Linux/macOS  
    dig your-subdomain.host
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Network Configuration

### Custom Domain Integration

<Note>
Custom domain setup requires DNS configuration at your domain registrar. Contact support for assistance with advanced DNS configurations.
</Note>

For enterprise users wanting to use their own domains:

1. **Purchase domain** from a registrar (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc.)
2. **Create DNS records** pointing to your server IP
3. **Contact support** to configure SSL certificates
4. **Test thoroughly** before announcing to players

### Load Balancing & Proxies

For high-traffic servers, consider:

- **Reverse proxy setup** (Nginx, Cloudflare)
- **Multiple server instances** behind a load balancer
- **Geographic distribution** for global player base
- **CDN integration** for static content delivery
