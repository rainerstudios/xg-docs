The Activity tab provides a comprehensive audit trail of all server events, including administrative actions, server state changes, user activity logs, and system warnings or errors.

## Overview

The Activity feed displays a chronological timeline of server events, helping you:

- **Track administrative actions** performed by you and subusers
- **Monitor server state changes** (starts, stops, restarts)
- **Review user activity** for security and accountability
- **Identify system issues** through warnings and error logs

<Info>
All timestamps are displayed in your local timezone and include the user's IP address for security tracking.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing Activity Logs" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Problem**: Recent actions aren't showing in the activity feed
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Refresh the page to load the latest events
    - Check if time range filters are excluding recent activity
    - Verify that the action actually completed successfully
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unknown User in Logs" icon="user-question">
    **Problem**: Activity shows "Unknown user" for some actions
    
    **Explanation**:
    - User account was deleted but historical actions remain logged
    - System-generated events may not have an associated user
    - This is normal behavior and maintains audit trail integrity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Suspicious Activity Detected" icon="shield-exclamation">
    **Problem**: Unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts
    
    **Immediate Actions**:
    1. Change all account passwords immediately
    2. Revoke access for suspicious subuser accounts  
    3. Enable two-factor authentication if not already active
    4. Contact support with the relevant activity log details
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Exporting Activity Data

For compliance or detailed analysis, you can export activity data:

1. **Set appropriate filters** to narrow down the events you need
2. **Copy relevant entries** using browser selection tools
3. **Screenshot important events** for visual documentation
4. **Contact support** for bulk export assistance if needed

<Tip>
Activity logs are retained for 90 days. For long-term audit requirements, consider regularly exporting important events.
