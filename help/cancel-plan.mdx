# Cancel Your Subscription

Done with your gameplay? You can cancel your BerryByte server subscription plan at any time with flexible cancellation options. We make the process simple and transparent, with no hidden fees or complicated procedures.

### 1. Save any data

If needed, download any data or backups from your server before it’s deactivated. Once cancelled, the server data will no longer be accessible.

You can upload the backup whenever you're ready to start a server again.

### 2. Go to Billing

Log in to your [BerryByte billing account](https://billing.berrybyte.net/login) and select the service you want to cancel.

### 3. Submit cancellation

Find your active plan and choose the **Request Cancellation** button. Then, write a brief reason to why you're cancelling your plan; this helps us immensely in improving our services!

Finally, select between **Immediate** or **End of Billing Period** cancellation and press **Request Cancellation**.

Cancellations are processed at **9AM CST** every morning. Once the cancellation is processed, all server data is removed.

## Common Issues

**Accidental Cancellation**
- Contact support immediately if cancelled by mistake
