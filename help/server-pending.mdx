# Server Stuck on Pending

If you've rented a server and the order status is stuck on **Pending**, there may have been an issue with the automatic provisioning system. Don't worry - this is usually resolved quickly with the right steps.

## Quick Resolution Steps

1. **Wait 10 Minutes**: Most pending orders resolve automatically within this timeframe
2. **Check Your Email**: Look for order confirmation and an email named **"Account Created"** - use that email to login to the game panel
3. **Refresh The Page**: Sometimes the status updates but doesn't refresh automatically
4. **Contact Support**: If still pending after 10 minutes, let us know and our team can activate it immediately

## Common Causes

**Payment Processing Delays**
- Bank verification taking longer than usual
- Payment method requiring additional authentication
- High-volume periods causing processing delays

**System Maintenance**
- Scheduled maintenance affecting provisioning
- Server location experiencing high demand
- Automatic systems temporarily offline

**Account Verification**
- New account requiring manual verification
- Unusual payment patterns triggering security checks
- Geographic restrictions requiring review

## Common Issues

**Order Shows Pending for Hours**
- Contact live chat immediately for manual activation
- Provide your order number and email address
- Our team can resolve this within minutes

**Payment Charged But Server Not Created**
- This indicates a provisioning issue, not a payment problem
- Your server will be created once the issue is resolved
- No additional charges will occur

**Can't Access Game Panel**
- Wait for the "Account Created" email before attempting login
- Check spam folder for account credentials
- Use the direct login link provided in the email

## Prevention Tips

**For Future Orders**:
- Use established payment methods when possible
- Ensure billing information matches payment method exactly
- Order during off-peak hours for faster processing
- Keep your email accessible for verification if needed
