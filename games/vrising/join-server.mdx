## Common Issues

- **Server not appearing in server list**: Server may not be publicly listed or offline
  - **Solution**: Use direct connect method with IP address instead of server browser

- **"Server is full" message**: Server has reached maximum player capacity
  - **Solution**: Wait for player slots to open or increase server capacity in settings

- **Connection failed or timeout**: Network connectivity or server configuration issues
  - **Solution**: Verify server is running and check firewall/port settings

- **Version mismatch error**: Client and server running different V Rising versions
  - **Solution**: Ensure both client and server are updated to the same game version
