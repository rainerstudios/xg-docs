If you need to temporarily or permanently remove a player from your [V Rising dedicated server](https://xgamingserver.com/v-rising-server-hosting), you can use server commands or edit the ban list file.

## Using console commands

1.	Press ESC in-game and enable the Console Enabled checkbox in the General settings.
2.	Open the Console by pressing the backtick key (`) on your keyboard.
3.	Ensure youâ€™re [an admin on the server](./become-an-admin).
4.	Use the following commands as needed:
    - 	To kick a player: `kick <username>`
    -	To ban a player: `bancharacter <username>`
    - 	To unban a player: `unban <steamID>`

## Using banlist.txt file

You can alternatively use the banlist.txt file on your server to permanently ban players from your V Rising server.

1. Open the **Files** tab
2. Navigate to `/settings/banlist.txt`
3. Add the Steam ID of each player you want to ban, placing one Steam ID per line.
4. **Save** the file
5. **Restart** the server
