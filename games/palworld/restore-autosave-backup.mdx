Lost your server's save data, bases, character progress or need to rollback in time? Has your [Palworld server](https://xgamingserver.com/palworld-server-hosting) been wiped and is prompting you to create a new character?

By default, [Palworld](https://www.pocketpair.jp/palworld) servers [create automatic save backups](./enable-autosave-automatic-backups) that can allow you to go back to a previous save or restore player characters and base progress. Here are the steps:

## Restoring a backup

1. **Stop** the server
2. Open the **Files** tab
3. Navigate to `/Pal/Saved/SaveGames/<ID>/backup/world`
4. Go into the folder of the backup you would like to restore and select all files
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/games/palworld/palworld-select-backup.png" />
</Frame>
5. Press **Archive**, and **move the archive** to `/Pal/Saved/SaveGames`

</Frame>
6. **Unarchive** the archive to restore the save and overwrite existing files
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/general/unarchive.png" />
</Frame>
7. **Start** the server

This will rollback to the autosave to your server and restore the lost progress and fix the character prompting issue.
