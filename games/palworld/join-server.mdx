# How to Join a Palworld Server

Connecting to your Palworld server opens up the full multiplayer experience where you and your friends can explore the islands of Palpalagos together, collect Pals, build incredible bases, and survive in this captivating monster-hunting adventure. This guide covers everything you need to know about joining servers and troubleshooting connection issues.

To experience all of that, you'll need to know how to connect and join your Palworld server.

## Finding the IP address

Before you can join and connect to your [Palworld server](https://berrybyte.net/palworld), you'll need to find the [IP address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-address) (a combination of numbers, e.g `104.167.215.1`).

1. Login to the [game control panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Locate the subdomain or IP:port below the name of the server

3. Enter the IP address and port of your server into the field at the bottom
5. Click **Connect** which will connect and load you into your multiplayer server!

Allow the server a few moments to accept the connection and then voilà, you should now be able to join your Palworld server!

## Common Issues

- **"Failed to connect to server" error**: Server may be offline or IP address incorrect
  - **Solution**: Verify server is running in control panel and double-check IP address

- **Connection timeout when joining**: Network connectivity or firewall blocking connection
  - **Solution**: Check firewall settings and ensure ports 8211 and 27015 are accessible

- **Server not appearing in list**: Direct connection required for dedicated servers
  - **Solution**: Use the IP address connection method instead of server browser

- **Version mismatch error**: Client and server running different Palworld versions
  - **Solution**: Ensure both client and server are updated to the same version
