## Common Issues

- **"Failed to connect to server" error**: Server may be offline or IP address incorrect
  - **Solution**: Verify server is running in control panel and double-check IP address

- **Connection timeout when joining**: Network connectivity or firewall blocking connection
  - **Solution**: Check firewall settings and ensure ports 8211 and 27015 are accessible

- **Server not appearing in list**: Direct connection required for dedicated servers
  - **Solution**: Use the IP address connection method instead of server browser

- **Version mismatch error**: Client and server running different Palworld versions
  - **Solution**: Ensure both client and server are updated to the same version
