Sometimes, when [Pocketpair](https://www.pocketpair.jp/palworld), the devs behind the hit-game [Palworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/), release a new update, you may be faced with the error: `Sorry, you're currently prevented from playing with people on platforms other than the Xbox network.
