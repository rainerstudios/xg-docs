## Finding SteamID of a Player
To kick or ban a palyer on a Palworld server, you need to find the ID of the player:

1. [Join your Palworld server](./join-server) as an admin
2. Run the command `/ShowPlayers` in chat
3. Beside the name of the player, note down the **Player ID** or **Steam ID**

## Kicking a Player on Palworld
After you've found the Player ID or Steam ID of the player, let's kick 'em!

1. Make sure you're an [an admin](./become-an-admin) on the server
2. Run the command `/KickPlayer <ID>` in chat

And voil√†! The player will be kicked from the server.

## Banning a Player on Palworld
Still have the ID copied down? Here's how to permanently ban the player:

1. Make yourself [an admin](./become-an-admin)
2. Run the command `/BanPlayer <ID>` in chat

And the player won't be able to join the server anymore. Be wary of ban evasion with alt accounts though!
