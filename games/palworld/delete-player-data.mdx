If you need to reset or delete a specific player’s data while keeping your world intact, you can manually remove their save file. This lets players start fresh without wiping the entire server.


## How to Remove Player Data on a Palworld Server

Follow these steps to remove player data:

    1. Ensure [you're an admin on your Palworld server](./become-an-admin)
	2. Press **Enter** and type `/ShowPlayers` then copy the player ID displayed in the list.
	3. Open the **Files** tab
	4. Navigate to: `/Pal/Saved/SaveGames/0/<playerID>/Players/`
	5. Locate the `.sav` file that matches the copied player ID
	6. Select the file and **Delete**
	7. **Restart** the server

The player can now create a new character when they log in! This process ensures player data is reset without disrupting the server’s world or progress.
