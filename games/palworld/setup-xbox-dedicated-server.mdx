The new [Palworld Sakurajima update](https://blog.berrybyte.net/palworld-sakurajima-update-released/) brings [Xbox dedicated servers](https://xgamingserver.com/palworld-xbox-server-hosting). Want to setup your own Palworld server for Xbox? Use the following steps to allow connections from Xbox consoles (Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One) and the Microsoft Store version for Windows.

Cross-play between Xbox and Steam version is not possible at the moment. Here's how to convert a steam dedicated server to Xbox.

## Creating a Xbox Dedicated Server

To create an Xbox server and allow Xbox connections to your Palworld server, you need to modify the PalworldSettings.ini file and add the following content at the bottom of the file:

1. Login to the [game panel](https://game.xgamingserver.com)
2. **Stop** the server
3. Navigate to `/Pal/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/PalWorldSettings.ini`
4. Change `AllowConnectPlatform=Steam` to `AllowConnectPlatform=Xbox`
5. Change `ServerName` to a name of your choice
6. Save the file and start the server

Alternatively, you can append this into your PalWorldSettings.ini file:
```
[/Script/Pal.PalGameWorldSettings]
OptionSettings=(AllowConnectPlatform=Xbox)
```

## Configure Community Server

Once you've modified the config to allow Xbox connections, ensure the server is [configured as a community server](https://tech.palworldgame.com/getting-started/deploy-community-server). This is required as Xbox players can't join the server with an IP address, but rather join from the community server list.

To configure a Palworld server as a community server, add the `-publiclobby` option to your startup arguments and restart the server.

## Connect to Palworld Server on Xbox

1. Launch Palworld
2. Select **Join Multiplayer Game** from the main menu

4. Search for the name of your server and connect

Once completed, you should now be able to join your Palworld server on Xbox! You can simplify these steps and [rent a lag-free Palworld server](https://xgamingserver.com/palworld-server-hosting) from [XGamingServer](https://xgamingserver.com).
