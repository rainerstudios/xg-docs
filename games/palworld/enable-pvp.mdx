Enabling PvP allows players to engage in combat with each other on your Palworld server. By default, PvP is disabled, but you can easily turn it on through the server settings.

## Enabling Player vs Player combat (PvP) on a Palworld Server

Follow these steps to activate PvP and allow player-to-player damage on your server:

	1. Login to the [game control panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
	2. Navigate **Palworld Settings** tab
	3. Find **bEnablePlayerToPlayerDamage** and set it to **True**
    4. Find **bIsPvP** and set it to **True**
	5. Restart your server to apply the new PvP settings.

Players on your server can now engage in PvP combat! Adjust these settings at any time to control PvP behavior on your server.
