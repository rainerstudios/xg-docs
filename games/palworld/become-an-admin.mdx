# How to Become Admin on Your Palworld Server

Gaining administrator privileges on your Palworld server gives you complete control over gameplay, player management, and server settings. This guide covers the complete process of setting up admin access, logging in with admin privileges, and understanding the powerful commands available to server administrators.

## Set an Admin password
Before you can become an admin, you'll need to set a password.

1. Login to the [game panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. **Stop** the server
3. Navigate to the **Startup** tab and find the "**Admin Password**" option. Alternatively find the `AdminPassword` setting in PalWorldSettings.ini file
4. Set the password your choice there and make sure it's secure!
5. **Save** the changes and **Start** the server

## Login as Admin in Palworld

<Info>Currently you'll need to do these steps each time you login to become an admin</Info>

1. Press **Enter** to open chatbox
2. Type `/AdminPassword yourSecurePassword`
3. If the password is entered correctly, you'll be logged in as an admin and be able to use all [Palworld admin server commands](https://tech.palworldgame.com/server-commands)!

## Common Issues

- **Admin password not working**: Password may contain special characters or spaces
  - **Solution**: Use alphanumeric passwords without spaces or special characters

- **Admin commands not available**: Not properly logged in as administrator
  - **Solution**: Re-enter the `/AdminPassword` command and verify success message

- **Password resets after server restart**: Configuration not properly saved
  - **Solution**: Ensure server is stopped when setting password and save configuration

- **Can't find admin password setting**: Looking in wrong configuration location
  - **Solution**: Check both Startup tab and PalWorldSettings.ini file for AdminPassword option
