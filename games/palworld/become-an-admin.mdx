# How to Become Admin on Your Palworld Server

Gaining administrator privileges on your Palworld server gives you complete control over gameplay, player management, and server settings. This guide covers the complete process of setting up admin access, logging in with admin privileges, and understanding the powerful commands available to server administrators.

1. Login to the [game panel](https://game.xgamingserver.com)
2. **Stop** the server
3. Navigate to the **Startup** tab and find the "**Admin Password**" option. Alternatively find the `AdminPassword` setting in PalWorldSettings.ini file
4. Set the password your choice there and make sure it's secure!
5. **Save** the changes and **Start** the server

## Login as Admin in Palworld

2. Type `/AdminPassword yourSecurePassword`
3. If the password is entered correctly, you'll be logged in as an admin and be able to use all [Palworld admin server commands](https://tech.palworldgame.com/server-commands)!
