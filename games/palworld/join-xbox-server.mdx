The new [Palworld Sakurajima update](https://blog.berrybyte.net/palworld-sakurajima-update-released/) brings [Xbox dedicated servers](https://xgamingserver.com/palworld-server-hosting), and with it you'll need to know how to connect and join your Palworld server on Xbox.

## Enable community server

As you can't join a Palworld server with an IP addresses you'll need to enable your server as a community server.

To configure a Palworld server as a community server, add the `-publiclobby` option to your server's startup launch arguments. This is automatically done at [XGamingServer](https://xgamingserver.com/).

## Join and connect to Palworld Server on Xbox
1. Launch Palworld
2. Select **Join Multiplayer Game** from the main menu

4. Search for the name of your server to find it
5. Click **Connect** which will connect and load you into your multiplayer server!

Allow the server a few moments to accept the connection and then voil√†, you should now be able to join your [Palworld server](https://xgamingserver.com/palworld-server-hosting) from Xbox!
