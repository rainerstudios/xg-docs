By default, players in Palworld lose all items when they die. You can customize this by adjusting the serverâ€™s death penalty settings.

## Change Palworld Death Penalty Setting

	1. Login to the [game control panel](https://game.xgamingserver.com)
	2. Navigate **Palworld Settings** tab
	3. Find the **DeathPenalty** option in the settings list
	4. Select the dropdown and choose your preferred penalty ([list of all penalty options](#item-death-penalty-options))
	5. **Restart** your server to apply the new death penalty setting

Players will now experience the updated drop penalty based on your selection.

## Item Death Penalty Options

Here are the following death penalties you can use on a Palworld server:
