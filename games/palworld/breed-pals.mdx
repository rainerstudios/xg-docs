Breeding Pals is a fun way to build your dream team and explore new possibilities. Here's a quick guide on how breeding works in Palworld.

## Breeding Pals

- Put two compatible Pals (male and female) into the Breeding Pen.
- Make sure both Pals have high happiness by feeding them regularly and keeping their environment comfortable.
- Wait for the breeding timer to finish. You can check the progress directly on the Breeding Pen.
- When breeding is complete, you'll find a Pal egg. Collect it and incubate it until it hatches.

## Tips for Successful Breeding

- Happiness matters! Higher happiness levels speed up breeding times.
- Use high-quality food to boost happiness faster.
- Certain rare Pals may have special breeding conditions, so check each Pal's requirements.

That's all it takesâ€”enjoy expanding your Palworld family!
