# How to Install Mods on Your Palworld Server

Installing mods on your Palworld server unlocks endless possibilities for customized gameplay, new features, and enhanced experiences. This comprehensive guide covers the complete modding process, from selecting compatible mods to ensuring all players have synchronized installations for seamless multiplayer gameplay.

## Before You Start

- Make sure you have admin access to your server.
- Check if your mods are `.pak` files and work with your current Palworld version.
- Make sure everyone playing on your server installs the exact same mods, so everything runs smoothly.


## Steps to Add Mods

- Download the `.pak` mod file from a trusted site.
- Head to the **Files** tab on the [game panel](https://game.xgamingserver.com)
- Find the `Pal/Content/Paks/` folder.
- Upload your `.pak` mod file into this folder.
- On your PC, put the same `.pak` file into your Palworld game's `Pal/Content/Paks/` folder.
- Restart your server to activate your mods.

That's it! Enjoy customizing your Palworld server.

## Common Issues

- **Mods not loading after installation**: Incorrect file placement or incompatible mod version
  - **Solution**: Verify .pak files are in correct Pal/Content/Paks/ folder and compatible with server version

- **Players can't join modded server**: Client-server mod mismatch or missing client-side mods
  - **Solution**: Ensure all players have identical mod files installed in their game directory

- **Server crashes with mods**: Conflicting mods or corrupted mod files
  - **Solution**: Remove mods one by one to identify conflicts, re-download corrupted files

- **Mod features not working**: Server-side only mods or configuration issues
  - **Solution**: Check mod documentation for server requirements and configuration steps
