[Palworld](https://www.pocketpair.jp/palworld), being an early-access game, has been causing crashes and server instability, no matter what provider you're with. RAM being pinned hard only after a few hours of playing!

This is due to [memory leaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6o4hj6/eli5_what_is_memory_leak_and_what_does_it_affect/) in the game. Here are some methods you can use to optimize the server, reduce RAM usage, and mitigate crashes and memory leaks:

- Configure automatic server restarts every 3-6 hours (recommended)
- Disable `bEnableInvaderEnemy` (disables raids) and `bEnableNonLoginPenalty` in "**PalWorldSettings.ini**" file
- Upgrade your plan to more RAM (Palworld/Pocketpair recommends 16-32GB+ RAM)
- Decrease `DropItemMaxNum` from `3000` to `1000`
- Decrease `PalSpawnNumRate` from `1.0` to `0.7`
- Adjust server tickrate to 60 by adding this to the bottom of your `Engine.ini` (**Pal** -> **Saved** -> **Config** -> **LinuxServer**) file:
```
[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver]
NetServerMaxTickRate=60
```
