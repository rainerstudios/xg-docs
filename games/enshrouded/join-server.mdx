## Common Issues

- **Server not appearing in Steam server list**: Server may not be properly registered or offline
  - **Solution**: Verify server is running and try direct connection method instead

- **Wrong port causing connection failure**: Enshrouded uses different game and query ports
  - **Solution**: Try adding +1 to the port number if initial connection fails

- **"Server full" or capacity error**: Server has reached maximum player limit
  - **Solution**: Wait for player slots to open or increase server capacity in settings

- **Steam server browser not loading**: Steam connectivity or cache issues
  - **Solution**: Restart Steam client and clear Steam cache if necessary
