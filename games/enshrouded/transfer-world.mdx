3. Go to Files and select the savegame folder.

## Locating the Enshrouded world files
1. To explore the Enshrouded world files, locate the installation directory of steam. This often located under **C:\Steam\**
2. Navigate to the following directory: **\Steam\userdata\"steamid"\1203620\remote**
3. Locate the file with a string of 8 characters. This is often called **3ad85aea**
NOTE: If the game file has a different name please rename it to **3ad85aea** before uploading.

## Copying the file
1. This can either be done via the upload button in [game control panel](https://game.berrybyte.net) or simply drag and drop the file

Voila. Your new file is added. Happy Playing


## Common Issues

- **Save file not found in Steam directory**: Different Steam installation or user profile
  - **Solution**: Check alternative Steam installation paths or verify correct Steam user ID

- **World doesn't load after transfer**: Incorrect file naming or corrupted save data
  - **Solution**: Ensure file is named "3ad85aea" exactly and verify save file integrity

- **Server crashes after world upload**: Incompatible save version or corrupted data
  - **Solution**: Restore from backup and try re-exporting the save file from game

- **Progress lost after transfer**: Incomplete save file or missing character data
  - **Solution**: Verify all save components are transferred and check for additional save files
