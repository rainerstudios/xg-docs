Personalizing your server can attract players. One of the first things potential players see is your server icon in their multiplayer server list.
Here's how to set a custom server icon for your Minecraft server.

## Server Icon Specifications
Before creating your icon, know these requirements:

- **Size**: The icon must be 64x64 pixels. (You can use [imageresizer.com](https://imageresizer.com/) to resize the image)
- **Format**: The image should be saved as a PNG.
- **Name**: The file must be named and saved as `server-icon.png`.

1. Save your icon as `server-icon.png` and a size of 64x64px.
2. Upload the icon to the main directory of your server (**Files -> Upload**)
