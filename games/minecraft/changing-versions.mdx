# How to Change Your Minecraft Server Version

Changing your Minecraft server version allows you to access new features, maintain compatibility with player clients, or revert to previous versions for stability. This guide covers the complete process of version management, including Java compatibility requirements and best practices for preserving your server data during transitions.

## Changing the version of your Minecraft Server

1. Stop your server and take a [backup](../../lime/backups)
2. Navigate to "**Startup**" tab, and change the `Version` field to the version you wish to use
3. In the "**Settings**" tab, press "**Reinstall**" to start the update process
4. Start the server and run `/version` command to check if the version has been changed

<Warning>Downgrading server versions is far more difficult as you cannot port whole worlds back versions without a backup. It requires you to manually move builds with schematics, and proper checking for new blocks.</Warning>


### What Java version do I need for each version in Minecraft?

You may encounter a Java error in the console when updating a new version, this
could mean that you have an incompatible Java version. To fix this, you can
update your Java version or change the `Java Version` variable in the
"**Settings**" tab to the appropriate version:

    * **Java 8**: Minecraft 1.14 - 1.16.5
    * **Java 16**: Minecraft 1.17 - 1.17.1
    * **Java 17**: Minecraft 1.18 - Newest (Recommended - Stable)
    * **Java 18 - 21**: Newest

And voil√†, you're done! You can now enjoy the new version of Minecraft on your server!

## Common Issues

- **Server won't start after version change**: Usually caused by Java version incompatibility
  - **Solution**: Update Java version in Settings tab to match Minecraft version requirements

- **World corruption after downgrading**: Newer world data isn't compatible with older versions
  - **Solution**: Restore from backup taken before version change, or use world conversion tools

- **Plugins stop working after update**: Plugin compatibility varies between Minecraft versions
  - **Solution**: Update plugins to versions compatible with your new Minecraft version

- **Players can't connect after version change**: Client-server version mismatch
  - **Solution**: Ensure all players update their Minecraft client to match server version
