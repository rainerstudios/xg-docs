## Find the IP address of your Minecraft Server

Before you can join and connect to your [Minecraft server](https://berrybyte.net/minecraft), you'll need to find the [IP](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-address) (a combination of numbers, e.g `104.167.215.1`) or a subdomain (letters, e.g `test.berrybyte.net`).

1. Head to the [BerryByte game panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Locate the subdomain or IP:port below the name of the server

3. Click on the highlighted area box and it will copy the IP to your clipboard


## Joining a server on Java Edition
1. Launch Minecraft
2. Select **Multiplayer** from the main menu
3. Click **Add Server** to add the server to your server list
4. Enter a name and your server's IP:port in the **Server Name** and **Server Address** field
5. Click on the server from the server list to join your server!

Alternatively, you can select **Direct Connection** and enter the subdomain or IP:port in the **Server Address** field. This lets you directly connect without having to add a server to the server list first. 

## Joining a server on Bedrock Edition
1. Launch Minecraft and select **Play** from the menu
2. Select the **Servers** tab from the top of the screen
3. Scroll past the featured servers and click **Add Server**
4. Fill in the **Server Name** and **Server Address** and **Port** fields and **Save**
5. Select your server from the list and click **Join Server** to join the server!

Allow the server a few moments to accept the connection and then voilà, you should now be able to join your Bedrock server!
