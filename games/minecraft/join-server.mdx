# How to Join a Minecraft Server - Java and Bedrock Edition

Connecting to your Minecraft server is the first step to enjoying multiplayer gameplay with friends. This guide covers everything you need to know about joining servers on both Java and Bedrock editions, from finding your server IP address to troubleshooting common connection problems.

## Find the IP address of your Minecraft Server

Before you can join and connect to your [Minecraft server](https://berrybyte.net/minecraft), you'll need to find the [IP](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-address) (a combination of numbers, e.g `104.167.215.1`) or a subdomain (letters, e.g `test.berrybyte.net`).

1. Head to the [BerryByte game panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Locate the subdomain or IP:port below the name of the server

3. Click on the highlighted area box and it will copy the IP to your clipboard


## Joining a server on Java Edition
1. Launch Minecraft
2. Select **Multiplayer** from the main menu
3. Click **Add Server** to add the server to your server list
4. Enter a name and your server's IP:port in the **Server Name** and **Server Address** field
5. Click on the server from the server list to join your server!

Alternatively, you can select **Direct Connection** and enter the subdomain or IP:port in the **Server Address** field. This lets you directly connect without having to add a server to the server list first. 

## Joining a server on Bedrock Edition
1. Launch Minecraft and select **Play** from the menu
2. Select the **Servers** tab from the top of the screen
3. Scroll past the featured servers and click **Add Server**
4. Fill in the **Server Name** and **Server Address** and **Port** fields and **Save**
5. Select your server from the list and click **Join Server** to join the server!

Allow the server a few moments to accept the connection and then voilà, you should now be able to join your Bedrock server!

## Common Issues

- **"Connection timed out" error**: Server may be offline or firewall blocking connection
  - **Solution**: Check server status in control panel and verify IP address is correct

- **"Can't resolve hostname" error**: DNS issues or incorrect server address
  - **Solution**: Try using the numeric IP address instead of subdomain

- **"Outdated client/server" message**: Version mismatch between client and server
  - **Solution**: Ensure your Minecraft client matches the server version

- **Bedrock players can't join Java server**: Different editions aren't compatible by default
  - **Solution**: Install the [Geyser plugin](/games/minecraft/plugins/geyser) to allow cross-platform play
