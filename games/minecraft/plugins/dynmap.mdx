# How to Install and Configure Dynmap Plugin for Live Server Maps

Dynmap transforms your Minecraft server into an interactive web-based experience by creating live, Google Maps-style views of your worlds that players can access through any web browser. This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic installation to advanced reverse proxy configuration for custom domains.

There are more optimized alternatives like [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap) and [squaremap](https://github.com/jpenilla/squaremap), but Dynmap is still a popular choice for many Minecraft servers.<br/>

This guide will walk you through installation and usage of Dynmap on your [Minecraft server](https://xgamingserver.com/minecraft)!

## Installation

<Warning>
    You will need a public IP or a port forwarding service to allow other people to use your Dynmap, if you're running your Minecraft server locally.
</Warning>

To install and configure Dynmap on your Minecraft server, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of the Dynmap plugin from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap%C2%AE.274/) or the Dynmap mod from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynmapforge) (if you're running a modded server).
2. Place the downloaded JAR file in the `plugins`/`mods` (depends on your server software; `plugins` for Bukkit-based servers, `mods` for Forge and Fabric) folder of your Minecraft server. Refer to [this guide](../../../lime/importing-files) for help.
3. Restart the server. The plugin will automatically be installed and activated
4. When the server has fully started, stop the server to start configuring the plugin
5. Create a port in the "**Network**" on the game panel
6. Navigate to the `plugins/dynmap` folder in your server's directory
7. Edit the `configuration.txt` file and set the port to the one created in the 5th step, and a URL path you want to use for the Dynmap web interface (e.g. /dynmap), and save
8. Start the server again. Dynmap will now be fully installed and configured

## Reverse proxy

To use a custom domain for Dynmap instead of a long numerical IP, you can use a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) which allows you to access Dynmap using a custom domain name!

#### With Lime at XGamingServer

If you have a [Minecraft server from XGamingServer](https://xgamingserver.com/minecraft), we've simplified all steps below to a few buttons on [Lime](https://game.xgamingserver.com), where you can easily set up a reverse proxy for Dynmap using the [Proxies Manager](lime/proxies) tool. We take care of SSL certificates and all the configuration for you.

1. Create a DNS record for your custom domain to point to `cotton.api.xgamingserver.network`. If you're using [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), make sure to set the proxy status to DNS only.
2. Head to the Proxies Manager tool and click on the "**Create Proxy**" button.
3. In `Source`, input the domain used in step 1. In `Allocation`, input the allocation you created for Dynmap in the installation steps and press "**Create**".

Head to your domain, and it should be all ready and configured!

#### Locally or at another provider (Advanced)

<Warning>
    This part of the guide presumes you have a Debian/Ubuntu-based server, steps may differ for other OSs.
</Warning>

**Automatically:**

All the steps stated below after the 2nd step have been simplified to a single command for your convenience:

```bash dynmap.conf
curl -s https://cdn.xgamingserver.com/scripts/dynmap.sh | sudo bash
```

**Manually:**

1. Set up a server to act as the reverse proxy. This can be a dedicated physical or virtual machine from a public cloud provider (order one at https://xgamingserver.com/vps ;) ).
2. Install a web server on the machine which you intend to run the reverse proxy on (e.g. Nginx, Apache, etc.): `sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install nginx`
3. Set up a DNS record for your custom domain to point to the IP address of the reverse proxy server.
4. Configure the web server on the reverse proxy server to act as the proxy for Dynmap. This will involve adding a configuration block to the web server's configuration file that specifies the custom domain you want to use for Dynmap and the IP address and port of the Minecraft server where Dynmap is running.

```nginx dynmap.conf
server {                                                                                                                                                   
    server_name your-domain.com;
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/reverse-error.log;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://YOUR-REVERSE-PROXY-IP-ADDRESS;
    }
} 
```

5. Restart the web server to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

6. Test the reverse proxy by accessing Dynmap using your custom domain.

Note that setting up a reverse proxy can be a complex process, and it is recommended that you have some experience with web servers and network configuration before attempting it. If you are unfamiliar with these topics, it may be helpful to seek the assistance of a qualified system administrator or engineer.

## Usage

To view the Dynmap map, open a web browser and go to the IP address of the server, followed by the port and the `webprefix` path (if you've set one in the configuration file), e.g. http://yourdomain.com:20029/dynmap; this will launch Dynmap's web interface!

On the left side of the interface, you will see a list of available maps. You can switch between these maps using the dropdown menu at the top. On the right side of the interface, you will see a list of players currently online on the server. You can click on a player's name to view their location on the map. You can also use the search bar at the top of the interface to search for specific locations or players on the map.

## Customization

Dynmap has a wide range of customization options, which can be accessed by clicking on the "**Configure Dynmap**" button at the top of the web interface. From here, you can adjust settings such as the map's zoom level, the visibility of players and markers on the map, and the appearance of the map itself.

For more advanced customization options, you can edit the configuration.txt file in the `plugins/dynmap` folder on your server. This file contains detailed documentation for all available customization options.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble using Dynmap, here are a few common issues and their solutions:

- If the Dynmap web interface is not loading, check the `server.log` file in the logs folder of your server for any error messages related to Dynmap. This can help identify the cause of the issue.
- If the map is not showing the correct area, check the `worlds.txt` file in the `plugins/dynmap` folder to ensure that the correct world is being mapped.
- If the map is not updating in real-time, check the `updaterate` option in the configuration.txt file. This setting determines how often the map is updated, and can be adjusted as needed.

## Common Issues

- **Dynmap web interface won't load**: Usually caused by port configuration or firewall issues
  - **Solution**: Verify the port is correctly configured and accessible, check server firewall settings

- **Map shows blank or doesn't update**: World mapping configuration or permissions issue
  - **Solution**: Check `worlds.txt` file and ensure correct world is mapped, verify plugin permissions

- **Players can't access Dynmap externally**: Network configuration or port forwarding issue
  - **Solution**: Ensure port is properly forwarded and accessible from external networks

- **High server resource usage**: Dynmap can be resource-intensive during initial map generation
  - **Solution**: Consider using alternatives like BlueMap or squaremap for better performance
