[Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky) is a Bukkit plugin (and a mod), that
can be used to pre-generate chunks for a Minecraft server. World
pre-generation helps with **reducing CPU usage** in the long-term, since players
move through chunks that are already generated. Thus, allowing your server to be more optimized and reduce the risks of lag spikes, and more.

This guide will walk you through installation and usage of Chunky on your Minecraft server!

## Installation

### Bukkit-based servers

To get started with pre-generating your world on a Bukkit-based server, download the plugin's JAR file from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/).

Before using the plugin, place the downloaded JAR file into your `plugins` folder (either drag and drop the jar into the file manager or [use SFTP](../../lime/importing-files)).

### Forge or Fabric-based servers

To pre-generate worlds on modded servers, download the mod's file from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunky-pregenerator-forge) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/chunky). Once downloaded, place the downloaded JAR file into your `/mods` folder (either drag and drop into the file manager or [use SFTP](../../lime/importing-files)).

Restart the server and Chunky should be good to go!

## Usage

<Warning>
    Note that pre-generation increases world size substantially, so make sure you have enough free space on your disk. Check out [onlinemo.de/world](https://onlinemo.de/world) to calculate how large your world(s) will be before pregenerating them.
</Warning>

Using the plugin is fairly easy, however always [take a backup of your server](../../lime/backups) before you start, just to be on the safe side.

Chunky is a powerful tool with loads of commands, but we will only use these:

1. `/chunky radius <chunk-size>` - sets the radius from the center to be pre-generated
    - the radius is how many blocks from the center chunk will be pre-generated
2. `/chunky center <x> <z>` - sets the center of the chunks to be pre-generated
    - the center is the chunk that the pre-generation will start from, most people should leave it as default, but it can be changed
3. `/chunky setcorners <x1> <z1> <x2> <z2>` - sets the corners of the chunks to be pre-generated
4. `/chunky start` - starts the generation process
5. `/chunky pause` - pauses the generation process
6. `/chunky resume` - resumes the generation process
7. `/chunky stop` - stops the generation process
8. `/chunky status` - shows the status of the generation process

See [Chunky's documentation](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky/wiki) for more commands and useful tips.

### Example

To pregenerate a 5000x5000 chunk area centered at `0,0`, you would use the following commands:

- `/chunky radius 5000`
- `/chunky center 0 0`
- `/chunky start`

<Warning>
    Don't go crazy high with the radius! It can take a while (hours in fact) to pre-generate a world.

    Although you can play while running the plugin, you **will** experience some noticeable lag, so it's best to start it before you head to bed and wake up to a pre-generated server in the morning.
</Warning>

Once Chunky is done, all the chunks from X 5000 and Z 5000 to X -5000 and Z-5000 have been pre-generated.
