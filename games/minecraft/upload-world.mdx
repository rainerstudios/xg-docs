# How to Upload Custom Worlds to Your Minecraft Server

Transferring your favorite singleplayer worlds or custom maps to your Minecraft server allows you to share amazing builds and adventures with friends. This guide covers the complete process of locating world files on your computer, safely uploading them to your server, and configuring everything for seamless multiplayer gameplay.

<Warning>Ensure the world version matches your Minecraft server version to prevent corruption or compatibility issues.</Warning> 

## Finding a singleplayer world from your computer

If you wish to upload a singleplayer world from your computer to a [Minecraft server](https://xgamingserver.com/minecraft), follow these steps: 

### On Windows:

1. Enter `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard and enter `%AppData%`
2. Head to the `.minecraft` folder and then `/saves`
3. Locate the world you wish to upload, and archive the folder with a tool like [WinRAR](https://winrar.com) or [7Zip](https://7zip.com)

### On a Mac:

1. Navigate to `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` folder by pasting the file path on your Mac's [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/search-with-spotlight-mchlp1008/mac)
2. Right click the world folder, and select "**Compress [fileName]**"

## Uploading the world to your server

1. Stop the server
2. [Upload the world archive](../../importing-files) to the **File Manager** on the [game panel](https://game.xgamingserver.com/)
3. Select the three dots beside the file, and click "**Unarchive**"
4. Modify the `level-name` value in `server.properties` file to the name of the world folder
5. Start the server!

And voil√†, you should now be able to use and play your custom world on your Minecraft server!

## Common Issues

- **World doesn't load after upload**: Version mismatch or incorrect folder structure
  - **Solution**: Verify world version matches server version and check folder contains level.dat file

- **Server crashes when loading custom world**: Corrupted world data or missing files
  - **Solution**: Re-upload the world archive and ensure all world files are included

- **Players spawn in wrong location**: World spawn point not properly configured
  - **Solution**: Use `/setworldspawn` command or edit level.dat with NBT editor

- **Custom world features missing**: Incomplete world upload or version compatibility issues
  - **Solution**: Ensure complete world folder was uploaded and versions are compatible
