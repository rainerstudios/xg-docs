# How to Fix Minecraft 'Connection Timed Out' Error

The "connection timed out" error is one of the most frustrating issues Minecraft players encounter when trying to join servers. This comprehensive troubleshooting guide covers all common causes and proven solutions to get you back into the game, whether the issue stems from network problems, server configuration, or resource limitations.

## Reasons

1. The game server (or a proxy like [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) or [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity)) has insufficient
   resources to handle the amount of players.
2. There is an outage/issue with the host's network - you can check for incidents on our
   [status page](https://status.xgamingserver.com/).
3. The proxy (e.g. [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/), [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity), or [Waterfall](https://papermc.io/software/waterfall)) is misconfigured (only applies if you
   have one). Check the configuration files and make sure you've set it up correctly.
4. There is a problem with your
   [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) (Internet Service Provider) - this is the
   case most of the time. Restart your router or contact your internet provider for further help.

## Remedy

- Double-check your proxy's configuration, if you have one.
- Restart the Minecraft Server.
- See if anybody else experiences these issues on your server, if not, it's most
  likely a problem with your connection. You can test by using [mcsrvstat.us](https://mcsrvstat.us), a free website to check the status of a Minecraft server.
- Use a VPN or proxy. We recommend using [Cloudflare's WARP](https://1.1.1.1/) - a tool that helps you connect to a network with more [optimized routes](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/). This is a popular remedy especially for lower-end connections.
- Increase the [`paper.playerconnection.keepalive`](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/reference/system-properties#paperplayerconnectionkeepalive)
  timeout flag on your Paper-based Minecraft server. To add, insert the  `-Dpaper.playerconnection.keepalive=90` flag to your Minecraft server startup flags; this extends the keepalive timeout to 90 seconds.
- Take an [MTR](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mtr/) (my trace-route, a tool which allows one to diagnose network paths and routes) and analyze the output. [Share the output](https://xgamingserver.com/tickets) with the [XGamingServer](https://xgamingserver.com/) team and we can identify where the issue lies.


## Common Issues

- **Timeout occurs only for specific players**: Usually ISP routing or regional network issues
  - **Solution**: Try using Cloudflare WARP or a VPN to change network routing

- **Timeout happens during peak hours**: Server resource limitations or network congestion
  - **Solution**: Upgrade server resources or optimize server performance with Aikar's flags

- **Proxy servers causing timeouts**: Misconfigured BungeeCord, Velocity, or Waterfall setup
  - **Solution**: Review proxy configuration files and ensure proper server connections

- **Intermittent timeouts**: Network instability or packet loss between client and server
  - **Solution**: Run MTR diagnostics and contact hosting provider with results
