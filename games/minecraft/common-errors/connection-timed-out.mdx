One of the most common issues while playing on a [Minecraft Server](https://berrybyte.net/minecraft) is the "**server connection timed out**" error, preventing you from joining the server. You may be experiencing high ping or getting timed out while playing Minecraft, it could be due to various reasons like a bad internet connection, configuration issue, or you're running out of server resources.

## Reasons

1. The game server (or a proxy like [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) or [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity)) has insufficient
   resources to handle the amount of players.
2. There is an outage/issue with the host's network - you can check for incidents on our
   [status page](https://status.berrybyte.net/).
3. The proxy (e.g. [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/), [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity), or [Waterfall](https://papermc.io/software/waterfall)) is misconfigured (only applies if you
   have one). Check the configuration files and make sure you've set it up correctly.
4. There is a problem with your
   [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) (Internet Service Provider) - this is the
   case most of the time. Restart your router or contact your internet provider for further help.

## Remedy

- Double-check your proxy's configuration, if you have one.
- Restart the Minecraft Server.
- See if anybody else experiences these issues on your server, if not, it's most
  likely a problem with your connection. You can test by using [mcsrvstat.us](https://mcsrvstat.us), a free website to check the status of a Minecraft server.
- Use a VPN or proxy. We recommend using [Cloudflare's WARP](https://1.1.1.1/) - a tool that helps you connect to a network with more [optimized routes](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/network-layer/what-is-routing/). This is a popular remedy especially for lower-end connections.
- Increase the [`paper.playerconnection.keepalive`](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/reference/system-properties#paperplayerconnectionkeepalive)
  timeout flag on your Paper-based Minecraft server. To add, insert the  `-Dpaper.playerconnection.keepalive=90` flag to your Minecraft server startup flags; this extends the keepalive timeout to 90 seconds.
- Take an [MTR](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mtr/) (my trace-route, a tool which allows one to diagnose network paths and routes) and analyze the output. [Share the output](https://berrybyte.net/tickets) with the [BerryByte](https://berrybyte.net/) team and we can identify where the issue lies.
