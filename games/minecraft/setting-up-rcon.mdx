RCON, short for Remote Console, is a tool that allows server admins to execute Minecraft server commands remotely. This tool is incredibly useful for managing your server without having to be in the game.

## How to Enable RCON

RCON is disabled on Minecraft servers by default, so you'll need to manually enable it. Here's how:

1. Stop your server
2. Head to **Files -> `server.properties`**
3. Find `enable-rcon=false` and set it to `enable-rcon=true`
4. To secure RCON, change `rcon.password` to a secure password and `rcon.port` to a new working port (**Network -> Create Allocation**)
5. **Save** the file and restart your server

And voil√†! RCON is now setup for your server and secure!
