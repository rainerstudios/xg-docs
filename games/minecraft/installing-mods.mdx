# How to Install Forge and Fabric Mods on Your Minecraft Server

Installing mods on your Minecraft server opens up endless possibilities for enhanced gameplay, new features, and custom content. This comprehensive guide covers both Forge and Fabric mod installation, helping you transform your vanilla server into a modded experience with popular mods from CurseForge and Modrinth.

## Install Forge Mods

To get started with installing Forge mods onto your server, you'll need to make sure your server is set to Forge, and the appropriate server version for the mod too.

Here's how to set your server to Forge if it already isn't:
1. Open the **Settings** tab on the [Game Panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Select the "**Software**" dropdown and select **Forge**
3. Input the version of Forge you'd like in the **Startup** tab into the "**Server Version**" field
3. Press the "**Reinstall**" button to install Forge and wait for it to complete

Once the server version and Forge has been set, download the mod of your choice (from places like [CurseForge](https://cureforge.com) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com)) to your computer and follow these steps: 

1. Open the **File Manager** tab
2. Navigate to the `/mods` folder
3. [Upload](../../importing-files.mdx) the Forge or Fabric mod you wish to install
4. Restart your server and the Forge mod should be installed!

## Install Fabric Mods

Installing Fabric mods onto your Minecraft server is a simple process. Make sure the server version and the software is set to Fabric:

1. Open the **Settings** tab on the [game panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Select the "**Software**" dropdown and select **Fabric**
3. Press the "**Reinstall**" button to install Fabric and wait for it to complete

Once done, and you have the Fabric mod you wish to use downloaded and ready to upload, follow these steps to get it installed onto your Minecraft server:

1. Open the **File Manager** tab
2. Navigate to the `/mods` folder
3. [Upload](../../importing-files.mdx) the Forge or Fabric mod`.jar` to that folder
4. Restart your server and the Fabric mod should be installed!

<Note>Many Fabric mods require the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) mod installed to work. Download the Fabric API mod and upload it to the `/mods` folder</Note>

## Common Issues

- **Mods not loading after restart**: Check that the mod is compatible with your server version and mod loader
  - **Solution**: Verify mod compatibility and ensure you're using the correct Forge/Fabric version

- **Server crashes when starting with mods**: Usually caused by incompatible mods or missing dependencies
  - **Solution**: Check server logs for error messages and remove problematic mods one by one

- **Fabric mods not working**: Many Fabric mods require the Fabric API to function
  - **Solution**: Download and install the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) mod

- **Players can't join modded server**: Client-side mods must be installed on both server and client
  - **Solution**: Ensure players have the same mods installed or use server-side only mods
