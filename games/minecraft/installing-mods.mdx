## Install Forge Mods

To get started with installing Forge mods onto your server, you'll need to make sure your server is set to Forge, and the appropriate server version for the mod too.

Here's how to set your server to Forge if it already isn't:
1. Open the **Settings** tab on the [Game Panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Select the "**Software**" dropdown and select **Forge**
3. Input the version of Forge you'd like in the **Startup** tab into the "**Server Version**" field
3. Press the "**Reinstall**" button to install Forge and wait for it to complete

Once the server version and Forge has been set, download the mod of your choice (from places like [CurseForge](https://cureforge.com) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com)) to your computer and follow these steps: 

1. Open the **File Manager** tab
2. Navigate to the `/mods` folder
3. [Upload](../../importing-files.mdx) the Forge or Fabric mod you wish to install
4. Restart your server and the Forge mod should be installed!

## Install Fabric Mods

Installing Fabric mods onto your Minecraft server is a simple process. Make sure the server version and the software is set to Fabric:

1. Open the **Settings** tab on the [game panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Select the "**Software**" dropdown and select **Fabric**
3. Press the "**Reinstall**" button to install Fabric and wait for it to complete

Once done, and you have the Fabric mod you wish to use downloaded and ready to upload, follow these steps to get it installed onto your Minecraft server:

1. Open the **File Manager** tab
2. Navigate to the `/mods` folder
3. [Upload](../../importing-files.mdx) the Forge or Fabric mod`.jar` to that folder
4. Restart your server and the Fabric mod should be installed!

<Note>Many Fabric mods require the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) mod installed to work. Download the Fabric API mod and upload it to the `/mods` folder</Note>
