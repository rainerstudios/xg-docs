Looking to convert your Minecraft world into a different version, like making a Java world for Bedrock or a Bedrock world for Javas? [Chunker](https://chunker.app/) is a free website that allows you to upload worlds and convert a Minecraft Java world to Bedrock Edition and a Bedrock world to Java Edition.

This Minecraft converstion tool has been developed by the [HiveMC](https://playhive.com) team. This [BerryByte](https://berrybyte.net/minecraft) guide will show you how to use Chunker to convert your world and use it within a couple minutes!

{/* <Info>Chunker is a third-party external tool not endorsed nor developed by BerryByte. Users should use this tool at their own discretion and contact them directly for inquiries.</Info> */}

## Converting a world with Chunker

  1. Visit the [chunker.app](https://chunker.app/) website.
  2. Save your Minecraft world folder ([Java](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition)) or .mcworld file ([Bedrock](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bedrock_Edition)).
  3. Upload the folder or archive of the world you wish to convert to Chunker.
  4. Click the "**Start Upload**" button.
  4. Select the world version/format you want to convert to.
  5. Click on the “**Convert & Download**” button.
  6. Wait for the conversion to finish.
  7. Once done, press "**Download**" to save the world to your computer.
  8. Enjoy your newly converted world!

  Download links are normally valid for **up to 30 minutes**, and cannot be shared as they're connected to your web session.

Once done, you can enjoy your newly converted Minecraft world! If you converted a Java world to Bedrock, use the `mcworld` file to access it. If you've converted a Bedrock world to Java, copy the folder into your saves folder or [upload the folder](../../lime/importing-files/) to your [Minecraft server](https://berrybyte.net/minecraft) to use.
