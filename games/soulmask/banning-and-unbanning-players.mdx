## Finding SteamID of a Player
To kick or ban a palyer on a Soulmask server, you need to find the ID of the player:

1. Visit the [SteamID Finder website](https://steamid.io)
2. In the search bar, input the player's Steam profile URL or username
3. Click lookup, and copy the SteamID64 value

## Banning a Player in Soulmask
After you've found the Player ID or Steam ID of the player, let's permanently ban them:

1. Make yourself [an admin](./become-an-admin)
2. Run the GM command: `gm EnableServerPermissionList 1 1`
3. In the **Startup** tab, or to your startup arguments, add `-serverpm=2`

</Frame>
2. Run the command: `AddServerPermissionList 1 <steamID>`

And the player won't be able to join the server anymore. Be wary of ban evasion with alt accounts though!

## Unbanning a Player in Soulmask

To unban a player from your Soulmask server, you will need to run the following GM command:

1. Ensure you're an [an admin](./become-an-admin) on the server
2. Open the console by pressing the `~` key in-game. 
3. Run the command: `RemoveServerPermissionList 1 <steamID>`
