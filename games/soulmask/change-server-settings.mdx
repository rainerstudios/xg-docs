3. To open the console, press the `~` key in-game. 
4. Type `gm key <yourPassword>`
5. The next screen will prompt for your admin password again, and press **Become the Admin**
6. Once all done, you can change the server settings as you like!

## Common Issues

- **Admin password not working**: Password may contain special characters or incorrect format
  - **Solution**: Use alphanumeric passwords without spaces or special characters

- **Console not opening with ~ key**: Different keyboard layout or key binding conflict
  - **Solution**: Try alternative console keys or check game key bindings in settings

- **"Become the Admin" button not appearing**: Admin password not properly set or server restart needed
  - **Solution**: Verify admin password is saved and restart server if necessary

- **Settings changes not saving**: Admin privileges not properly activated
  - **Solution**: Re-authenticate as admin and ensure you have proper permissions
