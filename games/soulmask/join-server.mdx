# How to Join Your Soulmask Server

Connecting to your Soulmask server unlocks the full multiplayer tribe-building experience where you and your friends can collaborate to build civilizations, manage tribes, and survive together in this innovative multiplayer survival game. This guide covers the complete connection process and troubleshooting for seamless gameplay.

## Finding the IP address

Before you can join and connect to your Soulmask server, you'll need to find the [IP address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-address) (a combination of numbers, e.g `104.167.215.1`).

1. Login to the [game control panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Locate the subdomain or IP:port below the name of the server

## Common Issues

- **"Failed to connect to server" error**: Server may be offline or IP address incorrect
  - **Solution**: Verify server is running in control panel and double-check IP address and port

- **Password authentication failed**: Incorrect server password or special characters
  - **Solution**: Verify password is correct and avoid special characters that may cause issues

- **Connection timeout during join**: Network connectivity or firewall blocking connection
  - **Solution**: Check firewall settings and ensure server ports are accessible

- **Server incompatible version**: Client and server running different Soulmask versions
  - **Solution**: Ensure both client and server are updated to the same game version
